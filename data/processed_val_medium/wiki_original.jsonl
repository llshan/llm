{"text": "was a Japanese stage and screen actress whose career was most prolific in the United States during the silent film era of the 1910s through the 1920s. Aoki may have been the first Asian actress to garner top billing in American motion pictures. Life and career Born in Tokyo, Aoki came to California in 1899 with her uncle, Otojirō Kawakami, his geisha wife, Kawakami Sadayakko, and Otojirō's troupe of actors. At their first stop in San Francisco, Tsuru performed with the troupe and assisted Sadayakko at a Palace Hotel tea ceremony where attendees raved over her \"diminutive daintiness.\" But when the troupe ran into severe financial difficulties, Otojirō made arrangements to have Tsuru adopted by Toshio Aoki, a sketch artist for a local newspaper. Tsuru Aoki started taking lessons in ballet dance in New York City, when she went along with her uncle Toshio, who was hired by David Belasco for The Darling of the Gods. After Toshio's death a reporter looked after Aoki. Aoki began her acting career after returning to Los Angeles and performing in stage productions in the city's Japanese Theatre where she was noticed by film producer Thomas Ince who placed the young actress under contract. She was also responsible for recruiting Japanese actors for Imperial Japanese Company, a subsidiary of New York Motion Picture Corporation. Aoki made her film debut in the Majestic film studios release The Oath of Tsuru San in 1913 opposite actor William Garwood. Her follow-up film was the 1914 Ince produced O Mimi San, which starred the American child actress Mildred Harris and a young Sessue Hayakawa, whom Aoki had acted with onstage at the Japanese Theatre the previous year. The couple began a romantic relationship that culminated in their marriage on May 1, 1914, weeks before the release of their critically acclaimed and publicly successful film The Wrath of the Gods – a melodrama about an interracial romance between a man portrayed by Caucasian actor/ director Frank Borzage and an Asian woman portrayed by Aoki. The film also starred Sessue Hayakawa and featured actress Gladys Brockwell. Hayakawa and Aoki eventually made more than 20 films together throughout the 1910s and 1920s. One of Aoki's most recalled films of the silent period is the 1919 William Worthington-directed The Dragon Painter, based on the novel of the same title by Sidney McCall, in which Aoki starred as a young woman who convinces an isolated, mentally deranged artist named Tatsu (portrayed by Hayakawa) to come down from the mountains so that she may civilize him and he may further his artistic abilities. Other notable films of the period were The Typhoon (1914), The Vigil (1914), The Geisha (1914), The Chinatown Mystery (1915), His Birthright (1918), and The Breath of the Gods (1920). Throughout the 1910s, Aoki appeared in approximately 40 films, often in leading-lady roles which was a first for an Asian actress. Some of her co-stars of the era included such notable names as Marin Sais, Frank Borzage, Gladys Brockwell, Mildred Harris, Jack Holt, Jane Wolfe, Dagmar Godowsky, Vola Vale, Florence Vidor, Earle Foxe, and Walter Long. After a series of moderately successful Ince-produced two-reel serials, Aoki's career in the United States began to falter (while her husband's career began to build momentum), and the couple travelled to France in 1923 and filmed the popular -directed drama La Bataille. After returning to America, however, Aoki made only three more films before retiring from the screen to raise her and Hayakawa's three children. Her last silent screen performance was the 1924 release The Danger Line. Aoki returned to the screen in 1960 (her first sound film) to appear with her husband in the drama Hell to Eternity. She died the following year in Japan of acute peritonitis at the age of 69.

If is a complex-valued, continuous function on the contour and if its absolute value is bounded by a constant for all on , then where is the arc length of . In particular, we may take the maximum as upper bound. Intuitively, the lemma is very simple to understand.

{"text": "The Djadochta Formation (sometimes transcribed and also known as Djadokhta, Djadokata, or Dzhadokhtskaya) is a highly fossiliferous geological formation situated in Central Asia, Gobi Desert, dating from the Late Cretaceous period, about 75 million to 71 million years ago. The type locality is the Bayn Dzak locality, famously known as the Flaming Cliffs. Reptile (including dinosaur) and mammal remains are among the fossils recovered from the formation. Excavation history The Djadochta Formation was first documented and explored—though only a single locality—during paleontological expeditions of the American Museum of Natural History in 1922–1925, which were part of the Central Asiatic Expeditions. The expeditions were led by Roy Chapman Andrews, in company of Walter Willis Granger as chief paleontologist and field team. The team did extensive exploration at the Bayn Dzak (formerly Shabarakh Usu) region, which they nicknamed Flaming Cliffs given that at sunset the sediments of this locality had a characteristic reddish color. Notable finds included the first known fossils of Oviraptor, Protoceratops, Saurornithoides, and Velociraptor, the first confirmed dinosaur eggs (a partial nest of Oviraptor), as well as fossil mammals. Some of these were briefly described by Henry Fairfield Osborn during the ongoing years of the expeditions. In 1927 the formation was formally described and established by Berkey and Morris, with Bayn Dzak as the type locality. In 1963, the Mongolian paleontologist Demberelyin Dashzeveg reported the discovery of a new fossiliferous locality of the Djadochta Formation: Tugriken Shireh. During the 1960s to 1970s, Polish-Mongolian and Russian-Mongolian paleontological expeditions collected new, partial to complete specimens of Protoceratops and Velociraptor at this locality, making these dinosaur species a common occurrence in Tugriken Shireh. Some of the most notable excavations made at Tugriken Shireh include the Fighting Dinosaurs (Protoceratops and Velociraptor locked in combat), and abundant articulated, in situ (in the original pose), and sometimes complete skeletons of Protoceratops. During the 1980s, a joint Soviet-Mongolian paleontological expedition discovered several Mesozoic fossil-rich localities in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Among these sites, Udyn Sayr was discovered and examined by the expedition, regarding its age as Late Cretaceous. This new locality was predominantly rich in avimimid fossils, with a lesser abundance of mammal and other dinosaur fossils. In 1993 teams of a collaborative Mongolian-North American expedition (supported by the Mongolian Academy of Sciences and American Museum of Natural History) discovered a new fossil locality of the Djadochta Formation called Ukhaa Tolgod (meaning \"Brown Hills\"). Like previous localities, Ukhaa Tolgod has yielded a prominent abundance of well-preserved fossils, including high concentrations of mammal, dinosaur, lizard, and egg remains. A vast majority of specimens from this locality are usually found in near-complete articulation. Overall, when compared to other Mesozoic fossil sites, the diversity of fossils in Ukhaa Tolgod is unusually high. Description The modern-day Djadochta Formation is set in an arid habitat of sand dunes with little freshwater apart from oases and arroyos, in the Gobi Desert. The dominant lithology of the Djadochta Formation is represented by non-marine, cemented reddish-orange and pale orange to light gray, medium to fine-grained sands and sandstones, which include minor deposits of calcareous concretions and orange-brown silty clay. Less abundant sedimentation comprises conglomerates, siltstones, fluvial (water-deposited) sandstones, and mudstones. The entire thickness of the formation in the Ulan Nur Basin is at least . Several aeolian processes (wind works) indicate the presence of large straight-crested dune-like structures, and smaller barchan (crescent-shaped) and parabolic (poorly U-shaped) dunes across the formation. Reddish sandstones are observed in numerous localities. Bayn Dzak (also spelled Bain Dzak, Bayanzag, Bayn Zag, Bayan Zag, or Shabarakh Usu; locally known as Flaming Cliffs): It is dominated by reddish-orange sandstones and well-sorted, unbedded, and medium-grained sands. The thickness of the strata at the Flaming Cliffs at least more than . Less abundant lithology of Bayn Dzak includes cemented and poorly-cemented siltstones, mudstones, and grayish conglomerates. The latter are better exposed at western escarpments of the Flaming Cliffs. Bayn Dzak is about in total thickness and can be divided into two sections: alternations of horizontally-bedded sandstone and mudstone in the lowermost part, and sandstone-dominated successions in the upper or main part. Tugriken Shireh (also spelled Tugrik, Toogreeg, Toogreek, Tugreek, Tugrug, Turgrugyin, Tugrugeen, Tögrögiin, Tugrikiin, or Tugrikin): This locality is about in thickness and characterized by poorly cemented, fine-grained sandstones that have colors varying from pink to yellowish-white. The predominant mineral is quartz, and lesser common minerals are represented by feldspars and lithic fragments. Both cross-stratified and structureless sandstones are scattered across Tugriken Shireh. Udyn Sayr (also spelled Udan Sayr, Udan Sair, Ulaan Sair, or Üüden Sair): Sediments of this locality are exposed across a region of more than . It is divided into lower (thickness of at least more than ) and upper (thickness of about ) beds. The lower beds are fluvial originated and dominated by sandstones and mudstones. The upper beds are likely of aeolian origin and consist of reddish, cross-stratified and structureless sandstones. Ukhaa Tolgod (also spelled Oka Tolga): The strata exposed at Ukhaa Tolgod is dominated by reddish sandstones, with some sandstones containing small amounts of conglomeratic lenses and/or cobbles and pebbles. Conglomerate itself is in this site, and to a lesser level are mudstones and siltstones, which are thin and laterally restricted. Cross-stratified and fine-structured sandstones are particularly abundant at Ukhaa Tolgod. Zamyn Khondt (also spelled Dzamyn Khondt, Zamin Khond, or Dzamin Khond): This locality is characterized by reddish, well-sorted, and fine-grained sandstones with calcareous concretions. Some aeolian beds are present and are finely stratified to massive, having a visible thickness of about . Stratigraphy and age The Djadochta Formation occurs in the Late Cretaceous period of the Campanian stage. Magnetostratigraphic datings from the Bayn Dzak and Tugriken Shireh localities suggest that the Djadochta Formation was deposited during a time of rapidly changing polarity at about 75 million to 71 million years ago. The Djadochta Formation is separated into a lower Bayn Dzak Member and an upper Turgrugyin Member, which represent very similar depositional environments. Further strata from the Bayn Dzak Member includes that of the Ukhaa Tolgod locality, and its overall age is regarded also within the Campanian. Based on the superposition of the members, the Tugrugyin Member overlies the Bayn Dzak Member making it somewhat younger, which indicates that the Bayn Dzak paleofauna lived somewhat earlier than that from Tugriken Shireh. However, it is not yet understood the precise temporal difference: Localities within the Djadochta Formation are considered to represent a sequence of progressively younger sediments and thereby paleofaunas. Ukhaa Tolgod may be younger than both Bayn Dzak and Tugriken Shireh. Based on their fossil record and strata, Udyn Sayr and Zamyn Khondt have been correlated with other Djadokhta localities, though fossils of Udyn Sayr may indicate that this locality is younger than Bayn Dzak and Tugriken Shireh. Examinations on the strata of the Alag Teg (also spelled Alag Teeg or Alag Teer) locality, once considered part of this formation, indicates that it belongs to a different geological formation: the Alagteeg Formation, which is slightly older than the overlying Djadochta Formation. Based on sediments and stratigraphic relationships, the lower part of the Bayn Dzak locality is correlated with the Alag Teg locality, making both sections part of the Alagteeg Formation. The upper or main part of the former locality is considered part of the Djadochta Formation itself, as it shares similar lithology and stratigraphic relationships with Tugriken Shireh. Depositional environment Based on strata and rock facies (such as sandstones and caliche) of the formation and coeval units (Bayan Mandahu) it is currently agreed that sediments of the Djadochta Formation were deposited by wind activity in arid paleoenvironments comprising sand dunes with a warm semi-arid climate. Fluvial sedimentation at the Ukhaa Tolgod locality indicates the presence of short-lived water bodies during the times of the formation, which also contributed to its deposition. Taphonomy A vast majority of articulated specimens from the Djadochta Formation are found in unstructured sandstones, indicating burial in situ by high-energy sand-bearing events. Some buried Protoceratops individuals are preserved in distinctive postures involving the body and head arched upwards, suggesting that the animals died in the process of trying to free themselves from the body of sand, where they eventually fossilized. As they were unable to escape burial, the sandy mass prevented carcasses from being scavenged by vertebrates. Most of these \"buried\" specimens are found with bite traces and large borings (tunnel-like holes made by small invertebrates) on bone joints areas and other surfaces, indicating that after death they were largely scavenged by invertebrates, such as skin beetles. It has been suggested that the repeated occurrence of these feeding traces at limb joints may reflect that the responsible scavengers focused on collagen at the joint cartilage of dried dinosaur carcasses as a source of nitrogen, which was very low in the arid Djadochta Formation environments. Examinations at the fossil preservation and sediments of Ukhaa Tolgod indicates that preserved animals were buried alive by catastrophic dune collapses. It is thought to have occurred when sand dunes became oversaturated with water resulting in their sudden downfall; heavy rainfall events likely acted as the triggering mechanism for this collapse. Examples from the Ukhaa Tolgod preservation include Citipati (brooding adults entombed atop nests and eggs); Khaan (a pair in close proximity likely killed by a single collapse event); and Saichangurvel (individual buried alive by a muddy dune). Paleobiota of the Djadochta Formation Among fossils, Protoceratops is extremely common in Djadochta localities. Bayn Dzak is reported as one of the localities with the highest concentration of Protoceratops fossils and has been noted as the \"Protoceratops fauna\". Adjacent to Bayn Dzak, at Tugriken Shireh, Protoceratops is also abundant. Other common dinosaur components of the paleofauna include Pinacosaurus and Velociraptor. Small vertebrates like lizards and mammals are rather abundant and diverse, with Adamisaurus and Kryptobaatar being the most abundant representatives. The paleofauna of the Djadochta Formation is very similar in composition to the nearby and coeval-regarded Bayan Mandahu Formation of Inner Mongolia. The two formations share many of the same genera, but differ in species. For instance, the most common mammal in Djadochta is Kryptobaatar dashzevegi, while in Bayan Mandahu it is the closely related K. mandahuensis. Similarly, the dinosaur fauna of Djadochta includes Protoceratops andrewsi and Velociraptor mongoliensis, which Bayan Mandahu yields P. hellenikorhinus and V. osmolskae. Although fossil plants are extremely rare in the Djadochta Formation, the great abundancy of herbivorous Protoceratops at the arid-deposited Tugriken Shireh locality indicates that it had a moderate coverage of bushes or other low-growing plants. The relatively low paleobiodiversity and climate settings of the Djadochta suggest that these conditions contributed to stressed paleoenvironments. Most of the fossil occurrences in the formation are occupied by Protoceratops, and small to medium-sized ankylosaurs, oviraptorids, and dromaeosaurids make much of the overall paleofauna. Large-bodied animals are absent or extremely rare in the formation. Comparisons with the Nemegt Formation further reflects stressed paleoenvironments. In contrast to Djadochta, Nemegt has yielded an extensive diversity of large dinosaur taxa, such as Deinocheirus, Nemegtosaurus, Saurolophus, Tarbosaurus, or Therizinosaurus. Most of these taxa are herbivorous, which combined with the mesic (well-watered) settings of the Nemegt Formation allowed the development of giant herbivores, in contrast to the stressed Djadochta Formation. Another indicative of stressed paleoenvironments is the almost non-existent amount of fully aquatic animals. Turtles are rarely recovered, and most are terrestrial such as Zangerlia. Tyrannosaurids found in the formation may belong to an indeterminate species of Tarbosaurus, possibly extending the time range of the genus. It is suggested that most of the fragmented hadrosaur, tyrannosaur and sauropod remains across the formation likely belong to non-endemic, passing by species.

{"text": "The Tagbanwa people (Tagbanwa: ) are one of the oldest ethnic groups in the Philippines, and can be mainly found in the central and northern Palawan. Research has shown that the Tagbanwa are possible descendants of the Tabon Man, thus making them one of the original inhabitants of the Philippines. They are a brown-skinned, slim, and straight-haired ethnic group. There are two major classifications based on the geographical location where they can be found. Central Tagbanwas are found in the western and eastern coastal areas of central Palawan. They are concentrated in the municipalities of Aborlan, Quezon, and Puerto Princesa. Calamian Tagbanwa, on the other hand, are found in Baras coast, Busuanga Island, Coron Island and in some parts of El Nido. These two Tagbanwa sub-groups speak the same languages but different tone and pronunciation and do not exactly have the same customs. History According to folk history, the Tagbanwa had an early relationship with Brunei, with the first sultan of Brunyu, from the place called Burnay. Formal history of the Tagbanwa tribe began in 1521 when Magellan's ships docked in Palawan for provisions. Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler, recorded that the Tagbanwa practiced the ritual of blood compact, cultivated their fields, hunted with blowpipes and thick wooden arrows, valued brass rings and chains, bells, knives, and copper wire for binding fish hooks, raised large and very tame cocks for fighting, and distilled rice wine. Until the latter part of the 17th century, southern Palawan was under the jurisdiction of the Sultan of Brunei, leading to friction between Spaniards and the Sultan. During this time, and for almost three hundred years, the Spaniards and the Muslims of Sulu, Mindanao, Palawan, and north Borneo were at war. In the 19th century, the Tagbanwa continued to believe in their native gods. Each year, a big feast is celebrated after each harvest to honor their deities. When the Spanish regime ended and the Americans occupied the Philippines, some changes came to the island of Palawan, and to the Tagbanwa. In 1904, Iwahig became the site of a penal colony, which displaced the Tagbanwa as it expanded. In 1910, the Americans put up a reservation for the Tagbanwa. In succeeding years, internal migration from the Visayan islands and from Luzon, the dominance of the Christian religion, and the absorption of the island into economic and political mainstream marginalized the Tagbanwa people. Ancestral domain In 1998, the Tagbanwa of Coron Island were awarded a Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT) over more than 22,000 hectares of land and sea. CADT is the title to the land and the sea that have sustained the community for centuries. It gives the Tagbanwa the right to manage the area and preserve its rich marine and land resources. The Coron Island Ancestral Domain of the Tagbanwa people covers the two villages of Banuang Daan and Cabugao, and the neighboring Delian Island. The ancestral domain is currently ruled by HM Tribal Chieftain Rodolfo Aguilar I, assisted by his Council of Elders. The Calamian Tagbanwa of Coron filed the first formal legal claim in the Philippines for their \"ancestral waters.\" The initiative also became the first ancestral waters claim to be recognized by a government. In March 2010, Tabganwas previously driven away from Calauit island were issued a CADT covering over 55,000 hectares in recognition of the communities' ancestral land and waters. The title covers the entire island and includes 50,000 hectares of ancestral waters surrounding the island. Culture Language The Tagbanwa people have their own native languages (Aborlan Tagbanwa, Calamian Tagbanwa, and Central Tagbanwa) and writing system, however, they are also proficient in speaking the Palawano language and several other dialects like Tandulanon, Silanganon, and Baras in each locality, while a significant number of them can comprehend Tagalog, Batak, Cuyonon, and Calawian languages. Indigenous Tagbanwa Religion Immortals Mangindusa: Also referred as Nagabacaban, the highest-ranking deity who lives in Awan-awan, the region beyond the Langit; the god of the heavens and the punisher of crime; also referred as Magindusa, the deity who gives humans their true souls called the kyaraluwa at birth, through the nose of the baby emerging from the vulva; never descends from Awan awan; he is depicted as sitting and swinging back and forth in a bintayawan Bugawasin: Wife of Mangindusa Dibuwatanin: The messengers of Mangindusa Tungkuyanin: Deity who sits on the edge of this sky-cover with his feet dangling into the universe; also sits looking down at the earth; if he were to raise his head and look up, he would fall into the nothingness Magrakad: A god found at exactly noontime on the other side of the sun; gives the warmth which sustains life and, when the people are ill, carries away sickness Bangkay: Spirits of the cloud region called Dibuwat; spirits of the people who have been killed by violence, poison, or those who died in giving birth Bulalakaw: Also called Diwata kat Dibuwat; they fly-travel throughout the cloud regions to help the people Polo: The benevolent god of the sea whose help is invoked during times of illness Sedumunadoc: The god of the earth, whose favor is sought in order to have a good harvest Tabiacoud: The god of the underworld in the deep bowels of the earth Diwata Kat Sidpan: A deity who lives in the western region called Sidpan; controls the rains Diwata Kat Libatan: A deity who lives in the eastern region called Babatan; controls the rain Tumangkuyun: Wash and keep clean the trunks of the two sacred cardinal trees in Sidpan and Babatan by using the blood of those who have died in epidemics; the blood he uses causes the colors of the sunrise and sunset Amyan: The hot, dry northeast winds Diwata katamyan: Invoked when the wet period lasts too long and these Amyan hot-dry winds are needed Salakap: The spirits of epidemic sickness which arrive on earth through the northwest winds Taliyakud: Chief god of the underworld who tends a fire between two tree trunks; asks the souls of the dead questions, where the soul's louse acts as the conscience that answers the questions truthfully; if the soul is wicked, it is pitched and burned, but if it is good, it passes on to a happier place with abundant food Diwata: General term for deities; they created the first man made from earth and gave him the elements of fire, the flint-like stones, iron, and tinder, as well as rice and most importantly, rice-wine, which humans could use to call the deities and the spirits of their dead Family structure The basic social unit of the Tagbanwas is their nuclear family composed of a married couple and their children. They are monogamous. They live in houses that are made up of bamboo and wood for a strong frame, anahaw leaves for roof and walls, and bamboo slats for the flooring. Tagbanwa live in compact villages of 45 to 500 individuals. Families can either be free men or nobles, which, in the Southern tribes are known as Usba. Visual arts and crafts The traditional costumes of the Tagbanwa were fashioned from the bark of trees, particularly the salugin. The preparation of this bark was unique. After being felled, the tree would be cut around the trunk, the outer bark stripped off to expose the inner layer. A mallet would beat the layer, until it is soft enough to hang loose from the bole. This is washed and dried under the sun. In the past, menfolk wore simple loincloths, supported by a woven rattan waistband called ambalad, while women wore only brief wraparound skirts made from bark. The Tagbanua later adopt some articles of Muslim clothing. At present, while many Tagbanwa still wear their traditional apparel, western-type clothing has found its way among the people. In the past, when both men and women wore their hair long, they filed and blackened their teeth, and carved earplugs from the hardwood bantilinaw. The Tagbanwa also carved wooden combs and bracelets. They strung bead necklaces to be used in covering women's necks. Anklets of copper and brass wire were also crafted and worn by women. Tagbanwa women wear bright body ornament and brightly colored clothes. They dress just like the non-tribe lowlanders but some elder men prefer to use G-strings for comfort while tilling the field or going fishing. Baskets and woodcarvings are the more notable products of Tagbanwa artistic crafts today. They excel in the number of designs they apply to their tingkop (harvest basket). These baskets are made of blackened and natural bamboo, which makes the designs stand out. The cone-shaped type of basket is another fine example of Tagbanwa skilled artistry. Using black and natural color designs outside, the center of the cone has the bamboo strip skived slightly smaller, creating even holes for the screen. The funnel effect is accomplished through a close weaving of the bamboo strips towards the top. The soft rice baskets, called bayong-bayong, are made with different unusual shapes. These have square bases and round tops. To produce interesting block and V-shapes, the plain buri sides superimposed with colored buri. Color is woven into the Tagbanwa basket with the used of dyed palm leaves. Blackened woodcarvings of animals, with simple etched or incised features exposing the original white grain of the wood, are the most well known examples of Tagbanwa woodcarvings or sculpture. Some of the objects carved are mammanuk (rooster), a ritual bowl, kiruman (turtle), kararaga (a native bird), dugyan (a small ground animal), lizards, and wild pigs. Carved animals are used with rice, betel nut, and other offerings to attract the deities and spirit relatives in the pagdiwata rituals. The turtles, for instance, floats on grains of palay in an ancient Ming trade bowl. Others that are not used in rituals become toys for children. Performing arts Music Complementing the rich Tagbanwa rituals and social gatherings in the past was an assortment of musical instruments. These included the aruding or jaw harp; the babarak or nose flute; the tipanu or mouth flute; the pagang and tibuldu, two variations of the bamboo tube zithers; the kudlung or boat lute; the gimbal or drum, whose top was made from the skin of the bayawak or monitor lizard; and the tiring, composed of lengths of bamboo with openings of various sizes producing different notes when struck with a stick. In addition, there were two generic types of gongs obtained from the shallow babandil. The mouth flute is still in use, and the gongs and drums are still played during rituals. Modern acoustic type guitar and the ukulele, which is fashioned from a half coconut shell, supplant the other instruments. Dance The known dances associated with the rituals are the following: abellano, also called soriano, a traditional dance performed by males; bugas-bugasan, a dance for all participants of a pagdiwata, after they have drunk the ceremonial tabad (rice wine); kalindapan, solo dance by the female babaylan and her attendants; runsay, ritual dances performed by the villagers on the seashore, where bamboo rafts laden with food offering are floated for the gods; sarungkay, a healing dance by the main babaylan as she balances a sword on her head and waves ugsang or palm leaf strip; tugatak and tarindak, dances perform by the villagers who attend an inim or pagdiwata; tamigan, performed by male combatants using round winnowers or bilao to represent shields. The dancing accompanying the runsay, performed about midnight and lasting until daybreak, is possibly the most moving of all Tagbanwa dances, since it is a part of a sacred ritual that takes place only once a year, and is performed on the beach from where the ritual raft has been launched towards the sea world. Guests who attend the albarka ritual watch dances such as the busak-busak, the spider dance; batak ribid, a dance simulating the gathering of camote; bungalon, a showing off dance; bugsay-bugsay, a paddle dance using fans; segutset, a courtship dance; and tarek, a traditional dance. The andardi is a festival dance of the Tagbanwa in and around Aborlan, perform at social gatherings. When dancing during a festival, the performers are dressed in their costumes, and hold in each hand a dried palm leaf called palaspas. The music of the andardi is composed of one part of twelve measures, played or sung continuously throughout the dance. Drum or gongs accompanies the music and the song. Drama Drama in Tagbanwa society is expressed in the mimetic dances imitating animals, such as busak-busak, and those showing occupations, such as batak ribid and bugsay-bugsay. But the most important mimetic forms are the rituals where the priestess is possessed by and plays the role of the deity to whom the offerings are being made. Economic activity They cultivate rice in swidden or kaingin field that is intercropped with sweet potato, corn, and cassava. Those in the coastal areas indulge in fishing and exchange it with agricultural products for consumption. They also gather forest products such as gum, rattan, and honey for cash. The highest potential source of income for the Tagbanwa are handicrafts particularly woodworking, mat making and basketry, the raw materials for which are readily available to them.

{"text": "General elections were held in Belize on 5 March 2003. Belizeans elected 29 members to the House of Representatives for a term of five years. The result was a victory for the ruling People's United Party (PUP), which won 22 of the 29 seats. Background The PUP were seeking a second consecutive term in office after recording significant development in the economy from 1998 to 2003. Their opponents, the UDP, sought to replace them in office because of charges of corruption and mismanagement of public funds. Previous to this election, the parties had alternated their time in office since independence. As an aside, municipal elections had originally been called for this date, creating a situation of triple elections in one day, a first for the Caribbean region according to Myrtle Palacio of the EBD. As a postscript, Cayo South winner Agripino Cawich Sr. died of illness in August 2003. UDP candidate John Saldivar, who had lost to Cawich in March, won the subsequent by-election over son Joaquin Cawich in October. This general election was also the first in Belizean history in which former Prime Minister George Cadle Price was not a candidate. Price, who stood down from the Pickstock constituency, had contested every prior general election since 1954, winning each time except 1984. After what Prime Minister Said Musa called a \"drawn-out\" campaign that he said affected the country's ability to function, Musa called a house meeting on January 24, 2003 and formally announced that he had asked Governor General Sir Colville Young to dissolve the National Assembly of Belize by February 4, decree nomination of candidates for elections on February 17, and call elections on March 5. Elections were called early; they had not been constitutionally due until at least November 2003. The Opposition UDP, led by attorney Dean Barrow and eager to recover from the disastrous 1998 campaign, declared themselves ready to battle. Governor General Young officially issued the proclamation dissolving the House on February 4, as requested by Mr. Musa. Campaign The People's United Party had nominated candidates through much of 2001 and 2002. Among the more hotly contested races was Pickstock, where Attorney General and Senator Godfrey Smith defeated Bobby Usher of the PUP old guard. A number of other sitting members declared that they would not run again, including Jorge Espat in Freetown (relieved by Francis Fonseca) and Henry Canton in Stann Creek West (replaced by Rodwell Ferguson). The PUP prepared a visually oriented campaign, stressing their accomplishments in office as the governing party and citing weak links in the UDP armor. The United Democratic Party's selection process was rife with controversy. In May 2002, Pickstock standard bearer and musician Kenny Morgan was removed (he would eventually be replaced by Diane Haylock). Attorney Wilfred Elrington contested Pickstock independently after running into party officials over Haylock's appointment; brother Hubert, who had already left the party, likewise contested independently in Lake Independence against the sitting Cordel Hyde. Another bone of contention was Albert, where the UDP selected Marilyn Williams over Sydney Fuller. Fuller ran independently but Williams was herself the subject of investigation over allegations that she was a U.S. citizen and therefore ineligible to participate in the elections. Representatives in Lake Independence and Belize Rural Central were also replaced. This was the first election for the We the People Reform Movement, which put up candidates in Corozal, Orange Walk and Belize District. Independents appeared in all six districts. The election was tagged as featuring the highest number of independent candidates ever, including former UDP candidate Wilfred Elrington in Pickstock. Elrington finished second to winner Godfrey Smith but doubled up UDP choice Diane Haylock. The 2003 general election can be considered one of the most glitzy and packaged. The PUP ran a mostly upbeat campaign, focusing on celebrating the works achieved in its five years in office. The campaign was highlighted by the release of a CD of political campaign songs written by prominent Belizeans, particularly \"Welcome to the Party\" by Supa G. \"Party\" saw three translations and numerous airings over the course of two months of campaigning, invariably accompanied by PUP officials smiling and making contact with their constituents. The UDP chose substance over style in a realist campaign. Their commercials and statements attacked what they saw as latent corruption in the PUP's governing of the country. In February a broadside of scandals rocked the retiring administration, in sectors as varied as transport and education, and the UDP pushed every single one as an indication of the things the UDP would not tolerate if elected. We The People and other independent candidates stressed their belief that the system needed to change and that overall life needed to be improved for all Belizeans. The independents were not as heavily represented on the media but saw their opportunities as they came. Conduct The elections were supervised by the Elections and Boundaries Department, headed by Chief Elections Officer Myrtle Palacio and her four person administrative staff. In preparation for the possibility of general elections and the certainty of municipal elections, the EBD had cleaned out their electoral rolls following the 1998 re-registration exercise, sought to boost voter confidence through the media, and trained fellow civil servants across the country to prepare for the rigorous test of conducting three separate elections in one day. The EBD commanded 1,432 election workers, 567 municipal, 865 general. The workers were divided according to post: returning officer (in charge of the station and vote), election clerks and assistants, presiding officers (at each polling area), poll clerks and assistants, and counting clerks. Statutory Instruments Nos. 14 and 43 of 2003 respectively guaranteed voters the right to register up to February 10, 2003 in lieu of nomination day and allowed for more counting agents assigned to the general elections. On election day itself, despite the usual early headaches, voting went smoothly. Palacio noted in her end of year report that no petitions for recounts were presented for any election. Nevertheless, The Guardian newspaper of March 16 saw an article written by then member of the Elections and Boundaries Commission and editor Herbert Panton, which criticized the electoral process. For more, see the Guardian article. A number of media houses joined forces to cover wire-to-wire the events of March 5. Great Belize Television (Channel 5) announced a partnership with RSV Media Center, headlined by LOVE FM, on January 13, 2003. Their coverage used the tagline \"Decision 2003.\" Later on, Tropical Vision Limited Channel 7 teamed up with fledgling Krem Television and Radio. Their coverage was nicknamed \"The Moment\" and used \"Lose Yourself\" by Eminem as its theme song. Election day began at 5:00 am for workers and 7:00 AM for voters. Voters participated from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM; counting began at 8:00 PM. Palacio reported that Pickstock's result, a victory for Godfrey Smith, was the first official result to come in, at 10:00 PM. By 12:45 AM Thursday morning, the PUP had amassed the majority fifteen seats, and by 1:10 AM could start celebrating as the CEO stamped the particulars. While the UDP had regained 6% of votes over the 1998 results, the PUP still beat them 53-45. Results By constituency References Belize Belize Legislative election General elections in Belize"}
{"text": "Alive is a 1974 book by the British writer Piers Paul Read documenting the events of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571. Story Alive tells the story of an Uruguayan rugby team (who were alumni of Stella Maris College), and their friends and family who were involved in the airplane crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571. The plane crashed into the Andes mountains on Friday 13 October 1972. Of the 45 people on the flight, only 16 survived in sub-zero temperatures. After eight days spent searching for survivors, two of which planes were grounded, the rescue team was forced to end the search. Consequently, the survivors had to sustain life with rations found in the wreckage after the plane had crashed. The rations did not last long, and in order to stay alive it became necessary for the survivors to eat the bodies of the dead. This was possible because the bodies had been preserved with the freezing temperatures and the snow. The book was published two years after the survivors of the crash were rescued. The author interviewed many of the survivors as well as the family members of the passengers before writing this book to obtain facts about the crash. He wanted to write the story as it had happened without embellishment or fictionalizing it. The author comments on this process in the \"Acknowledgments\" section: I was given a free hand in writing this book by both the publisher and the sixteen survivors. At times I was tempted to fictionalize certain parts of the story because this might have added to their dramatic impact but in the end I decided that the bare facts were sufficient to sustain the narrative...when I returned in October 1973 to show them the manuscript of this book, some of them were disappointed by my presentation of their story. They felt that the faith and friendship which inspired them in the cordillera do not emerge from these pages. It was never my intention to underestimate these qualities, but perhaps it would be beyond the skill of any writer to express their own appreciation of what they lived through. Reception The book was a critical success. Walter Clemons declared that it \"will become a classic in the literature of survival.\" Keith Mano of The New York Times Book Review gave the book a \"rave\" review, stating that \"Read's style is savage: unliterary, undecorated as a prosecutor's brief.\" He also described the book as an important one: Cowardice, selfishness, whatever: their essential heroism can weather Read's objectivity. He has made them human. 'Alive' is thunderous entertainment: I know the events by rote, nonetheless I found it electric. And important. 'Alive' should be read by sociologists, educators, the Joint Chief of Staff. By anyone, in fact, whose business it is to prepare men for adversity. Michel Roger concurs, stating that: \"Read has risen above the sensational and managed a book of real and lasting value.\" Editions The first edition was released in 1974. A paperback which referenced the film Alive: The Miracle of the Andes, was released in 1993. A new softcover edition, with a revised introduction and additional interviews with Piers Paul Read, Coche Inciarte, and Alvaro Mangino, was released by HarperCollins in 2005. This edition also has a new subtitle: Sixteen Men, Seventy-two Days, and Insurmountable Odds: The Classic Adventure of Survival in the Andes. The book was also re-released, simply titled Alive, in October 2012. Films Survive! is a 1976 film adaptation of the story. In 1993, Alive by Frank Marshall was released. A companion documentary, Alive: 20 Years Later, was made at the same time.

Cashmere (July 18, 1955 – December 2, 2002) was a prominent civil rights attorney who helped make same-sex marriage a major issue in Hawaii, as well as a historian and pioneer of organized Judaism in the state. Early life Born on July 18, 1955, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, his family moved to Hawaii when he was 5 years old. He attended the Iolani School and earned a degree in Near Eastern and Judaic studies at Brandeis University. Career Cashmere studied Law at the William S. Richardson School of Law at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. he served as legal director for the ACLU, worked with the Legal Aid Society of Hawaii and the Life Foundation, and was a member of the state's Ethics Committee from 1996 to June 30, 1999. As a member of the \"Governor's Committee on HIV/AIDS,\" he played a central role in formulating policy that would at once protect the public from unsafe exposure and maintain the confidence of carriers. Notable legal cases Camp H.M. Smith cross In 1984 and 1986, he filed suit against the Marine Corps to remove a 65-foot cross at Camp Holland M. Smith in Honolulu. Plaintiffs in the suit alleged that the cross is a religious symbol that violates the First Amendment. The cross had been erected for an Easter service in 1966, but naval officials argued it was a non-religious monument to prisoners of war and soldiers missing in action. Naval Admiral Judge Advocate T.E. Flynn decided to remove the cross in 1986, but that decision was overturned by Marine Corps commandant General Paul Kelley in 1987. In 1988, federal district court Judge Thomas Hogan ordered the cross to be removed. The cross was removed on December 1, 1988, and replaced with an 80-foot flagpole and a monument. Cammack v. Waihee On November 14, 1988, he challenged the state's Good Friday holiday as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment and the Hawaii State Constitution. The case was decided on August 9, 1991. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals court upheld Hawaii's right to declare Good Friday as an official state holiday. Baehr v. Lewin On May 1, 1991, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the First Circuit Court of Hawaii that the Hawaii Marriage Law was unconstitutional because it prohibited issuing a marriage license on the sole basis of same sex. On May 5, 1993, the Hawaii Supreme Court issued a decision in Baehr v. Lewin (later known as Baehr v. Miike). Cashmere was Lambda Legal Defense's local counsel and co-authored the amicus brief. In 1996, Cashmere was an attorney for three couples who sued Hawaii for denying marriage licenses on the sole basis the applicants were of the same sex. Circuit Judge Kevin Chang ruled that the state failed to prove a \"compelling reason\" to ban same-sex marriages. Death Cashmere died on December 2, 2002. A memorial service was held at Temple Emanu-El. The annual Kirk Cashmere Jewish Film Festival has been held in Honolulu from 2002 to 2019.

{"text": "During the fall of 1986 the band Theatre of Ice committed to its only extended tour of the United States. To accommodate the tour, three new members were added to the band; Jay Planty on guitar, Ted Preiss on bass, and Jason Cobb on drums. For the most part the tour was uneventful, playing mostly as a supporting act, the group performed before crowds that were largely unfamiliar with their history. On New Year's Eve, 1986, the tour concluded in Fallon, Nevada, the birthplace of the band, with a performance in what had long been alleged to be a haunted slaughterhouse. A large concrete edifice, the abandoned slaughterhouse had been the site of many strange sightings and the subject of local ghost stories for over 20 years. More of a video shoot and recording session than an actual concert, it was made open to the public and several hundred of the locals braved the spirits and the cold to attend the show. With their now stripped down, punkier sound, the band tore through several versions of In the Attic, Miron, Gone With the Worms, A Cool Dark Place to Die, Red Asphalt and Within the Ruins of a Mind. The concert was intended to conclude at the stroke of midnight, ushering in the New Year. But sometime slightly after 11:00pm a bizarre event occurred; all the power suddenly turned off and the slaughterhouse was thrown into total blackness. A few seconds later an unearthly moan howled forth from every speaker and amplifier. Another worldly wail that lasted nearly 30 seconds. Stunned and terrified, the majority of the crowd hastily dispersed and the concert came to a screeching halt. To this date it is still a matter of speculation as to whether this was an actual supernatural occurrence or was staged by the band in an attempt to add to their mystic and legend. What is known is that Jay Planty, Ted Preiss, and Jason Cobb left the band after the event. Planty and Preiss would return several years later, but this was the last time the band recorded at any alleged haunted sites or cemeteries. Three of the Songs from the session were chosen to be released as the band's first 7-inch ep, In the Attic. Along with the title track the record included Gone with the Worms and Within the Ruins of a Mind. The record was a howling success and was the first in what would be a long string of 7 inch eps the band would release. Musicians Brent Johnson - Vocals Dale Garrard - Guitar Jay Planty - Guitar Ted Preiss - Bass Jason Cobb - Drums Track listing \"In The Attic\" (Brent Johnson, Dale Garrard) – 3:42 \"Gone With The Worms\" (Brent Johnson, Dale Garrard) – 3:30 \"Within The Ruins Of A Mind\" (Jay Planty, Brent Johnson, Ted Preiss) – 7:12 Reviews OPtion Magazine - First 7\" vinyl release from this band who've previously released several albums. Musically and lyrically this outfit continues to offer dark, atmospheric, yet slashing horror rock. While this genre has become pretty formulaic, Theatre of Ice nevertheless demonstrate a distinctive sound. though they're hurt here by average production, which fails to bring out the vocals and instrumentation as clearly as it should. -- Steve Kiviat. Maximum Rock N' Roll, San Francisco, California - Very weird and funny production for a band that depends on ambience. Three songs, all in the spooky/cold vein. Bleak tunes, atmospheric guitar, and echoey vocals. -- TY. Flipside (fanzine), Los Angeles, California - Hidden beneath the layers of distortion are some catchy, spooky and funny songs. Bauhaus fans might to take note. -- Kirk. Burning Toddlers - Raw, gloomy rock that drags the listener along the razor's edge of insanity and despair. When TOI is at its best, it strikes a chord - then proceeds to rip that chord out full force. Spinal Jauntice - The ever mysterious TOI supposedly began more or less as \"hard rock\", now abandoning that realm for more experimental outings. \"In the Attic\" I suppose falls in between as the two merge, making the closest thing I've heard to an auditory hallucination. The two songs on side one are evil, in fact, but the voice just doesn't seem to click in well. That would have been enough for the makings of an average, visions-of-rapidly-splattering-bodies record. Then comes the epic 7-minute \"Within the Ruins of a Mind\", that totally grinds, with a shuddering, metallic sound that doesn't let up until it's over. A deathly 7\".

{"text": "Seven Sport is the brand and production department under which all sporting events on the Seven Network are broadcast. It broadcasts some of Australia's most prominent sporting events, such as the AFL, cricket, the Olympics and Paralympics, as well as horse racing and motor racing. In late September 2019, it was announced that Head of Sport Saul Shtein (who had been in the position since 2004) would be leaving the company after the AFL Grand Final, reportedly as a result of widespread company cost cutting and restructuring. He was replaced by long-time Seven Melbourne managing director Lewis Martin. History The Seven Network is a major player in Australian sports broadcasting. Australian rules football From the first year of television in Australia in 1956 to 2001, Seven was the main broadcaster of the VFL/AFL. From 1974 to 1986 Seven was along with the ABC the main broadcaster of the VFL showing replays and highlights of matches played that Saturday. In 1977 Seven paid the VFL $500,000 to broadcast the Grand Final and a further $500,000 to broadcast the Grand Final Replay also live with the drawn match watch by 1.2 Million viewers at the time the biggest daytime audience in Australia television history. In 1987, after taken over by new ownership from Sydney, HSV-7 lost the VFL rights to Broadcom who on sold the rights in Victoria to the ABC (Broadcom also sold the rights to TVW-7 in Perth) after offering less money compared to the previous year, the rights were regained the next year. In 2001 the Seven Network announced that after 45 years as the official broadcaster of the VFL/AFL that it would finished its partnership at the end of the season. Nine and Ten entered a joint rights deal with pay TV provider Foxtel to ensure that all eight matches of each round were televised, starting in 2002 and concluding in 2006. At the time and being the only broadcaster, Seven broadcast only one match at a timeslot at a time and showed highlights of other matches that were not broadcast. On 5 January 2006, Seven regained the rights to the AFL in the following broadcast deal, covering the period between 2007 and 2011 inclusive, in a joint contract with Ten and Foxtel. The cost of the deal was A$780 million, an A$280 million increase on the Nine/Ten/Foxtel 2002-2006 joint broadcast venture. Under the deal, Seven and Ten alternated the Brownlow Medal ceremonies and the AFL Grand Final; Seven televised the Friday night and Sunday afternoon Premiership season matches, while Ten televised the two Saturday matches and Foxtel televising the rest. Both Seven and Ten alternate in show the NAB Cup Grand Final, the Brownlow Medal count (2007, 2009 and 2011 were shown on Seven) and the AFL Grand Final (2008 and both in 2010). In 2011, it was announced that Seven and Foxtel would share the football broadcast rights from 2012 to 2016, bringing Ten's 10-year run to an end. Under the new deal, Seven would televise four games per week, and Foxtel would simulcast coverage of Seven's games and broadcast the other five weekly games live and exclusive. Seven televised the entire finals series, with Foxtel simulcasting all finals except for the Grand Final, which was televised live and exclusively by Seven. The deal required Seven to televise all but the Saturday afternoon match live into Victoria and Tasmania; all four games were shown live into the northern states on 7mate and games were shown live or on delay into Western Australia (night matches on 7mate, day matches on Seven) and South Australia (all on Seven) depending on Seven's television schedule. In 2015, Seven commenced broadcasting the WAFL and VFL showing one match a week and all finals from both competitions that did not clash with AFL games in each market, this followed the previous year where SANFL were being broadcast on under the same agreement. For both the WAFL and SANFL, it was the first time since 1987 that each league were broadcast on Seven with all three being on Seven after long association with the ABC ending the previous year. Also announced in 2015 that Seven would again be the sole free-to-air broadcaster of AFL matches, for the period between 2017 and 2022. Under the deal, Seven no longer televises the Saturday afternoon match into Victoria, however, matches in this timeslot involving interstate teams continue to be televised into their respective markets. Controversially, however, up to three matches involving each of all four of the Western Australia and South Australia clubs (the West Coast Eagles, , and ) are televised on a significant delay, with the telecast starting after the final siren has gone in real time. Under a revised deal (post COVID-19) agreement, Channel Seven will show up to five matches per week live on their networks, with Fox Sports broadcasting each and every game on either a Fox Footy or Fox Sports 503. Two matches of both the Eagles and Dockers in WA and one match of both the Crows and Power in SA was shown on a significant delay in the shortened 2020 season. On June 11 the AFL and the Seven Network extended its current agreement until 2022 for an extra two until the end of 2024 with the deal virtually the same as the original one signed prior to 2017. In 2022, Seven was announced as the sole free-to-air broadcaster of AFL matches, for the period between 2025 and 2031. Under the deal, Seven will broadcast Thursday Night Football for the first 15 rounds of each season. However, they will not be broadcasting any Saturday Night matches until the last 8 rounds of the H&A season into Victoria. Seven will continue to broadcast Friday Night & Sunday Afternoon football. These arrangements differ outside of Victoria, where every local team's match will be broadcast on free-to-air, though some matches involving WA & SA clubs will be on delay, similar to the previous deal. Olympics The network's coverage of the 2000 Sydney Olympics attracted a TV audience of over 6.5 million Australians for the opening and closing ceremonies. The broadcast also ran on the short-lived C7 Sport subscription channel. During its time as the broadcaster of the Olympic Games, it has won the Olympic Golden Rings for the Best Television coverage for the best television programme during the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. During the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Seven and NBC Universal were the major recipients of the Golden Rings; with Seven taking the Golden Rings for the best Olympic Programme, the Silver Rings for the best Olympic feature (NBC Universal received the Golden Rings), and the Bronze Rings for the Best Sports Coverage (behind SRG Switzerland and YLE Finland). During Seven's coverage of the XXIX Olympiad, numerous complaints by the general Australian public were made to the Seven Network for several reasons, including the lack of a broadcast of events to which Australia is not competing in, too many advertisements and at inappropriate times during events and poor commentating of events. There has also been media speculation about the editing of Olympic events by Seven; how live sound from events is faded and the commentary sound is the prominent sound feature. Seven had exclusive Australian free-to-air, pay television, online and mobile telephony broadcast rights to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The live telecast of the XXIX Olympiad was shared by both the Seven Network and SBS Television. Seven broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies and mainstream sports including swimming, athletics, rowing, cycling and gymnastics. In stark contrast, SBS TV provided complementary coverage focused on long-form events such as soccer, road cycling, volleyball, and table tennis. Seven's coverage of the 2008 Summer Olympics was widely criticised by viewers, with many angry at the networks contractual obligation to show AFL football over the Olympics. Viewers also complained that many team sports were delayed, with the absence of Roy and HG and with seemingly large amounts of advertising breaks during live events upsetting some viewers. Despite this, the International Olympic Committee awarded Seven the 'Golden Rings' award for \"Best Olympic Programme\". The award is given for the best overall Olympic coverage. From 2016, Seven once again became the home of the Summer Olympic Games, Winter Olympic Games and the Summer Paralympic Games. In October 2020, the Seven Network announced it would be the home of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing Commonwealth Games Seven screened the 2002 Commonwealth Games from Manchester and were the official broadcaster of the 2018 Commonwealth Games on home soil on the Gold Coast in April 2018. In July 2022, Seven also broadcast the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. Motor racing From 1963 to 1997, Seven was the home of motor sport in Australia as they broadcast the Australian Touring Car Championship (ATCC) and the Bathurst 1000. Seven were the first broadcasters to use race cam in the 1979 Bathurst 1000, which allowed them to talk to the drivers mid-race. The Seven commentary team included Evan Green, Will Hagon and Geoff Stone (late 60s to the mid 70s). It included Mike Raymond from 1977 to 1995 and Garry Wilkinson from 1978 to 1996 (V8 1000). Neil Crompton reporting from the pits from around 1985, Mark Oastler (1989–1996), Doug Mulray (1988–1994), Allan Moffat (1985–1996, V8 1000) and as a pit reporter Andy Raymond (early 90s). At the Bathurst 1000, Sandy Roberts or Bruce McAvaney would be the host during the early to mid 1990s. In 1997, Seven lost the rights to the ATCC to Network Ten, but still broadcast the Australian Super Touring Championship until the series' demise in 2001. In 2003, Seven Sport broadcast the Nations Cup and V8 Utes, before Network Ten broadcast the V8 Utes in 2005 after the collapse of organising body Procar Australia. From 2007 to 2014, Seven regained the rights to V8 Supercars. The commentary team included Neil Crompton, Mark Skaife and Mark Larkham. From 2015, Seven Sport broadcasts the Bathurst 12 Hour endurance race. In 2020, Seven regained the TV rights to the Supercars Championship, sharing the rights with Foxtel in a deal worth $200 million for 5 years (2021-2025). The new deal has Seven Sport show seven rounds of the Supercars Championship live and showing highlights of the rounds it is not able to televise. Cricket On 13 April 2018, Cricket Australia announced that the Seven Network had acquired free-to-air media rights to a package of events beginning in the 2018–19 season, under a six-year contract as part of a consortium with Foxtel. Seven would broadcast coverage of all test matches, Women's internationals, 43 Big Bash League matches per-season, and 23 Women's Big Bash League matches per-season. All events would be shared with the newly established Fox Cricket channel. This ended Nine's 45-year run as television rightsholder of international cricket in Australia. In September 2020, it was reported that Seven was attempting to exit its contract, citing an alleged breach of contract surrounding the scheduling of the 2020–21 season, and that the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia would diminish the quality of the 2020–21 Big Bash League season (violating a contractual obligation for the quality of events carried by Seven to meet that of the previous season). In November 2020, Seven lodged an affidavit in the Federal Court of Australia in Melbourne, seeking access to communications with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in regards to scheduling changes for India's 2020–21 tour of Australia. Seven took issue with the ODIs being moved to the start of the series rather than the test matches (which will be the final event of the series) as they would be exclusive to Fox Cricket, and the final test would overlap the end of the holiday season, reducing potential viewership. Seven West Media CEO James Warburton argued that \"there aren't many sports that would launch their season behind a paywall\", and that the broadcaster wanted to be \"fairly compensated for the value reduction caused by the changes to the schedule and other changes.\" Seven Network will be broadcasting 2023 ICC World Test Championship Final as part of the deal with the ICC. Rugby League In 2016, the Seven Network won the broadcasting rights deal to be the main broadcaster of the 2017 Rugby League World Cup in Australia, beating the other regular rugby league broadcasting channels of Fox League and the Nine Network to secure the deal. Theme Seven Sport has used \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" by Emerson, Lake & Palmer as its theme since 1989. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Seven used the music piece for Sporting events such as: AFL, Australian Open and Australian Touring Car Championship. Up until 2011, an abridged version of the opening fanfare was used. The music piece returned for introductions of the networks sporting coverage since 2018 AFL Grand Final with a version of the Fanfare for the Common Man being used for all sporting coverage including AFL, Cricket and Horse Racing.

{"text": "Cuyunon refers to an ethnic group populating the Cuyo Islands, along with northern and central Palawan. The Cuyunons hail originally from Cuyo and the surrounding Cuyo Islands, a group of islands and islets in the northern Sulu Sea, to the north east of Palawan. They are considered an elite class among the hierarchy of native Palaweños. They are part of the wider Visayan ethnolinguistic group, who constitute the largest Filipino ethnolinguistic group. History The Cuyonon jurisdictions during Pre-Hispanic times include Cuyo under the powerful Datu Magbanua, Taytay under the gracious Cabaylo Royal Family who met the remnants of Magellan's fleet who fled Mactan after Ferdinand Magellan died in battle, Paragua (Palawan) under Datu Cabangon who ruled south of Taytay and Busuanga under the peaceful Datu Macanas. During Spanish colonization of the Philippines, Cuyo was one of the territories of Palawan that had the strongest Spanish presence, even being the capital of the entire Palawan province as one point. Cuyonon culture Significant populations Although the Cuyonon language is so closely related to Kinaray-a in Panay, very few Cuyonons actually live or speak Cuyonon in Panay, they instead settled west to the island of Palawan where the ethnic group is so closely associated now, this being the Province of Palawan declared Cuyonon as its official language. The fact also remains that most of the other ethnic groups of Palawan can fluently speak this language because Cuyonon had been the lingua franca of the Province of Palawan for many centuries already. Indigenous Cuyonon Religion Immortals Diwata ng Kagubatan: goddess of the forest honored on top of Mount Caimana in Cuyo island Neguno: the god of the sea that cursed a selfish man by turning him into the first shark See also Tagalog people Kapampangan people Ilocano people Ivatan people Igorot people Pangasinan people Bicolano people Negrito Bisaya people Aklanon people Boholano people Capiznon people Cebuano people Eskaya people Hiligaynon people Karay-a people Masbateño people Romblomanon people Suludnon Waray people Lumad Moro people References Ethnic groups in Palawan"}

{"text": "The 1991 SummerSlam was the fourth annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on Monday, August 26, 1991, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. Nine matches were contested at the event, including a dark match held before the live broadcast. This was the second event to take place in Madison Square Garden, the first since 1988. SummerSlam 1991 is remembered for the on-screen wedding of Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth, dubbed \"A Match Made in Heaven\" by announcer Gene Okerlund. Savage and Elizabeth had been married in real life since December 1984. WWF personalities shown at the reception afterward included Bobby Heenan, Gene Okerlund, J. J. Dillon, The Undertaker, and Jake Roberts. The last two were uninvited guests. Roberts proceeded to frighten Elizabeth with his snake while Undertaker attacked Savage with an urn. This was contrasted with \"A Match Made in Hell\", the main event of the show, which was a handicap tag team match between WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior against Sgt. Slaughter, General Adnan, and Colonel Mustafa. It was Slaughter's final on-screen appearance as an Iraqi sympathizer, a storyline fueled by the Gulf War. Among the other on-screen highlights of the event was The Legion of Doom (Animal and Hawk) defeating The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobbs and Jerry Sags) to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. The team became the only tag team in wrestling history to have held the WWF Tag Team Championship, the NWA World Tag Team Championship, and the AWA World Tag Team Championship. Another highlight was Bret Hart winning his first singles championship in the WWF when he defeated Mr. Perfect for the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. After winning the match, Hart climbed into the stands to hug his parents Stu and Helen Hart. Background SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, eventually dubbed the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1991 event was the fourth event in the SummerSlam chronology and was scheduled to be held on Monday, August 26, 1991, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. Aftermath Highlights of the wedding reception for Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth were aired on the WWF's syndicated and cable programs, and included The Undertaker and Jake Roberts crashing the party. Savage – who was still barred from competing as an active wrestler, per his WrestleMania VII \"retirement match\" loss to the Ultimate Warrior – would become the target of Roberts' insults, which continued to grow through the fall of 1991. Eventually, Savage had enough and, while doing color commentary duties on WWF Superstars, came to the ring while Roberts was delivering an anti-Savage promo, only for Roberts to severely beat Savage, tie him into the ring ropes and allow his devenomized king cobra to bite his arm. The aftermath of that incident led to Savage's reinstatement as an active wrestler and a match at the \"This Tuesday in Texas\" pay-per-view event. Following his team's loss to Hogan and Ultimate Warrior, Slaughter re-evaluated his support of Iraq, acknowledged he had made a bad decision and became a face again, appearing in vignettes next to American landmarks, saying \"I want my country back.\" During an episode of Superstars, Jim Duggan was under attack from The Nasty Boys, and Slaughter made the save. Duggan and Slaughter teamed up to defeat the Nasty Boys and continued to team over the next several months; Slaughter also defeated Colonel Mustafa and General Adnan in a series of matches. Despite Slaughter's face turn, he was still named 1991's \"Most Hated Wrestler of the Year\" by Pro Wrestling Illustrated magazine for his pro-Iraqi gimmick. SummerSlam 1991 marked André the Giant's last United States pay-per-view appearance in his lifetime. By now using crutches to get around due to his continuing health problems with acromegaly, André would make several appearances during the WWF's tour of England in September and October 1991. These were his last appearances in the WWF during his lifetime, as he died on January 27, 1993. Also dealing with injuries was Mr. Perfect, who would take a three-month-long absence from the WWF to recuperate; he would return to WWF television as a heel-favoring color commentator on Superstars. He would not return to in ring competition again until the 1992 Survivor Series. Rick \"The Dragon\" Steamboat left the WWF before Survivor Series 1991 to return to WCW, Steamboat had been rumored to be \"squashed\" by The Undertaker to get him ready for his WWF World Title run against Hulk Hogan. Ted DiBiase would finish up his feud with his former manservant Virgil (and regain his Million-Dollar Belt in the process), quietly remove Sensational Sherri as his valet (who would move to be Shawn Michaels' valet), then team up with Irwin R. Schyster (IRS) to form Money Inc in early 1992. The Nasty Boys would move on into a feud with the Bushwhackers and the Rockers, which would be settled at Survivor Series. Power and Glory would split after the events of SummerSlam; Paul Roma departed WWF in October 1991, took some time off, then move to WCW and join the Four Horsemen (instead of Tully Blanchard, who was offered but refused due to low pay) in 1993, and Hercules would also move to WCW in early 1992 and become \"The Super Invader\" before heading to Japan the following year. Koko B. Ware would team up with Owen Hart to form \"High Energy\" and would pursue, unsuccessfully, the WWF World Tag Team titles. Ultimate Warrior controversy Off-screen, there was an incident involving The Ultimate Warrior and Vince McMahon at this event. One month before the pay-per-view, Warrior wrote a letter to McMahon threatening to no-show the main event tag team match unless paid $550,000 that he claimed was owed to him from his work at WrestleMania VII. In 2005, it was revealed by Hulk Hogan and Sgt. Slaughter that dealing with the matter physically for Vince McMahon was a possibility when they became aware of Warrior's threat. McMahon, who did not want Hogan and Slaughter to get into a physical altercation with Warrior, paid Warrior the money, and then fired him immediately following SummerSlam. Warrior later responded on his website to these allegations by stating he was owed money stemming from work performed at WrestleMania VII and that he was actually suspended by McMahon immediately after the show, but quit the WWF out of protest. McMahon would later state that while he couldn't make a last-minute change in the card due to the fans expecting the match, he \"could not wait to fire him\" after the pay-per-view, which according to Jake Roberts, he did- right after Warrior came through the curtain after the match. As a result Warrior was not present for the in-ring celebration with Hogan and Sid Justice following the match. In the aftermath, Warrior's anticipated feud with Jake Roberts – who, in another storyline that aired a few weeks earlier, had turned heel after tricking Warrior into believing he would aid him in his feud with The Undertaker – was canceled, and the Roberts-Savage feud was conceived instead. Roberts revealed in an interview that he was so furious with Warrior (because of the loss of money he could have made and the title run he was guaranteed with one of the company's biggest stars at the time), that he carried hostile feelings towards Warrior for many years.

{"text": "The 1992 SummerSlam was the fifth annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on Saturday, August 29, 1992, at Wembley Stadium in London, England and aired on tape delay on Monday, August 31, 1992. It was the first major WWF pay-per-view to take place outside North America. The pay-per-view included two main event matches. In the first, The Ultimate Warrior challenged \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. The Ultimate Warrior won the match by countout but did not win the title. In the other main event, \"British Bulldog\" Davey Boy Smith pinned Bret Hart to win the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. The undercard also included The Natural Disasters retaining the WWF Tag Team Championship against the Beverly Brothers and Shawn Michaels and Rick Martel wrestling to a double countout in a match with the stipulation that the wrestlers were banned from hitting each other in the face. As of April 2023, WWE considers this to be their seventh largest live gate in history with a disputed attendance of 80,355. This is behind only WrestleMania 32 (2016), WrestleMania III (1987), WrestleMania 35 (2019), WrestleMania 39 Night 2 (2023), WrestleMania 29 (2013), and WrestleMania 39 Night 1 (2023), with the largest of these being WrestleMania 32 at a reported attendance of 101,763 and the lowest being WrestleMania 39 Night 1 at 80,497. Some writers believe that the WWF inflated the attendance figure for WrestleMania III of 93,173, however, and that SummerSlam 1992 actually had a larger crowd. Between ticket prices and merchandise sales, the WWF made over $3,650,000 in revenue. Reviews of the event are almost all positive, with the Smith–Hart match rated as the best match in SummerSlam history. On April 29, 2022, it was announced that a 30th anniversary DVD and Blu-ray would be released for the United Kingdom and European markets to celebrate the anniversary of the event on August 29, exactly 30 years to the event taking place. The release would also include all live event dark matches for the first time which are not a part of the WWE Network showing or on the previous release. During a WWE Live event at London's O2 Arena that same day, it was announced that WWE would return to the United Kingdom to host another major stadium event titled Clash at the Castle in September 2022. Production Background SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, eventually dubbed the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1992 event was the fifth event in the SummerSlam chronology. SummerSlam 1992 was originally intended to take place at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. However, the WWF decided to move the event to Wembley Stadium in London, England due to the company's growing popularity in the United Kingdom and the possibility of increasing the revenue from the event. The event was scheduled to be held on Saturday, August 29, 1992, and it aired on tape delay on Monday, August 31. Shawn Michaels was originally booked to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship from Bret Hart, but the storyline was adjusted due to the change of venue. As a result, \"The British Bulldog\" Davey Boy Smith, a native of Golborne, a working-class town in the north of England, was chosen to win the belt. Storylines One of the main events was the Intercontinental Championship match between Bret Hart and Davey Boy Smith, brothers-in-law in real life as Smith was married to Diana Hart, Bret's sister. On television broadcasts leading up to SummerSlam, interviews with Diana and her mother Helen portrayed the family as being torn apart by the upcoming match. Bruce Hart publicly supported Smith, while Owen Hart sided with his brother Bret. Diana stated that she did not know who she wanted to win the match, as she had close ties to both men. She ultimately stated that she simply hoped that neither wrestler would get hurt. Prior to the match, Smith was hospitalized with a legitimate staph infection in his knee. Despite the concerns about his health, he decided to wrestle the match as planned. Bret Hart later revealed in an interview that he doubted the legitimacy of the injury. The other main event was a WWF Championship match between The Ultimate Warrior and Randy Savage. Although they had a previous run of house show matches in early 1989, the rivalry between them began in earnest in the fall of 1990, when Sensational Sherri, who was managing Savage, tried to arrange a match between Savage and Warrior. The Warrior refused to defend his WWF Championship against Savage, and he ripped up a contract that Sherri had given him. While they faced each other at house shows over the next few months, where Savage was unable to win the title, they never had a televised match with each other. Savage then interfered in the title match at Royal Rumble 1991, enabling Sgt. Slaughter to win the title. To settle the rivalry, Savage and the Warrior agreed to face each other in a retirement match at WrestleMania VII. The Warrior won the match, forcing Savage into retirement. However, Savage would be reinstated as an active wrestler in November 1991. by which time the Warrior had left the WWF. The following year, the rivalry was rekindled when the Ultimate Warrior, having returned to the WWF at WrestleMania VIII on April 5, 1992. was granted a shot at the WWF Championship, which Savage had won from Ric Flair earlier that same evening. Flair and his executive consultant Mr. Perfect, were upset that Flair had not been granted a rematch. They decided to cause trouble between Savage and the Warrior. In August, Perfect claimed that he was in negotiations with Savage and Warrior, who both had sought his managerial services, but refused to clarify which wrestler he would support at SummerSlam. At the SummerSlam Spectacular, a show designed to promote the pay-per-view, Savage and the Warrior teamed up to face The Nasty Boys. Perfect and Ric Flair interfered in the match, resulting in a count-out victory for the Nasty Boys and more animosity between Savage and Warrior. The undercard included two tag team matches: Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) and The Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) had been feuding in 1992 over the WWF Tag Team Championship. The Legion of Doom held the championship belts until dropping the title to Money Inc. This title change occurred after Hawk failed a drug test and was suspended. Once Hawk's suspension ended, a rematch was scheduled to take place at SummerSlam. The match was first scheduled as a title match but Money Inc. lost the championship to The Natural Disasters. Meanwhile, the Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) and the Beverly Brothers (Beau Beverly and Blake Beverly) had a rivalry dating back to a match aired on WWF Prime Time Wrestling on July 20, 1992. While Earthquake brawled with Beau and Blake, Typhoon attacked the Beverlys' manager, The Genius. When the Disasters won the WWF Tag Team Championship, their Summerslam match was transformed into a title match. The rivalry between Shawn Michaels against Rick Martel centred around Martel's attempts to steal Michaels' valet Sensational Sherri. During one of Michaels' matches televised on August 9, 1992, Martel came to ringside and winked at Sherri, who returned the gesture. At the SummerSlam Spectacular, Sherri came to the ring during one of Martel's matches and winked at him. Both Michaels and Martel were \"heel\" wrestlers who bragged about their good looks, and Sherri had them agree not to hit each other in the face during their SummerSlam match. Event Preliminary matches Before the pay-per-view broadcast began, two matches were taped for later showings on WWF Prime Time Wrestling. These matches were never advertised on US television in the weeks leading up to SummerSlam. The first match saw \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan and The Bushwhackers (Bushwhacker Luke and Bushwhacker Butch) defeat The Mountie and The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags) when Duggan pinned The Mountie. In the other match, Papa Shango defeated Tito Santana by pinfall. The actual pay-per-view opened with the Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) taking on Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster). The Legion of Doom used their size and power to wear down their opponents in the opening minutes of the match. Money Inc. gained the advantage when Hawk missed a flying clothesline. Hawk tried to tag in his partner but was unable for several minutes because Money Inc. kept him away from the corner where Animal was standing. Eventually, Hawk and Schyster hit each other at the same time. Hawk tagged Animal in, and the Legion of Doom attempted the Doomsday device, their signature move. Schyster stopped them, but Animal hit Schyster in retaliation, causing Schyster to run into DiBiase. Animal then powerslammed DiBiase and pinned him to get the victory. The second match of the broadcast pitted Nailz against Virgil. Nailz spent the majority of the match choking Virgil. Virgil recovered several times and performed several offensive maneuvers, but Nailz always regained the advantage. Ultimately, Nailz won the match by performing a sleeper hold. After the match, he attacked Virgil with a nightstick. In the following match, competitors Shawn Michaels and Rick Martel were unable, due to a pre-match stipulation, to hit each other in the face. The two men exchanged holds but were both preoccupied with looking to ringside for approval from Sensational Sherri. Martel gained the advantage by throwing Michaels to the outside of the ring and attacking him there. When the two returned to the ring, they took turns attempting to pin their opponent, pulling down their opponent's wrestling tights to reveal their buttocks each time. Michaels then kicked Martel and tried to pin him, but the referee stopped the three-count because Michaels' feet were on the ropes. Both wrestlers broke the pre-match stipulation by slapping each other in the face. Sherri pretended to faint, which drew the attention of both wrestlers. Michaels and Martel argued over who would carry Sherri backstage, with each man carrying her a few feet before being stopped by his opponent. Both wrestlers were counted out, but they continued to argue. Martel tried to revive Sherri by throwing a bucket of water over her head. Michaels dropped Sherri and chased Martel backstage; upset at being publicly humiliated and then left behind by both men, Sherri screamed and cried as she ran backstage. The tag team championship match came next, which saw the Beverly Brothers (Beau Beverly and Blake Beverly) attack the Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) before the bell. The Disasters used their size and strength to gain the advantage, but Earthquake accidentally performed an avalanche on Typhoon. The Beverlys controlled the match for several minutes, with Blake executing a splash and a front facelock. Typhoon recovered and clotheslined both opponents but was unable to tag in Earthquake. Later, Typhoon tried to tag again, but Beau distracted Earthquake; while the referee's back was turned, The Beverlys' manager, The Genius handed Blake a metal scroll, which Blake used to hit Typhoon. Typhoon recovered, however, and Earthquake entered the ring and controlled the remainder of the match. He performed a powerslam on Beau before pinning him with an Earthquake splash. The following match, which was not broadcast in the United Kingdom, pitted Crush against the Repo Man. Crush used his size advantage to perform a Gorilla press slam on Repo Man. Repo Man performed a back suplex, but Crush showed no sign that the move affected him. Crush continued to dominate the match with such moves as a belly to belly suplex. Repo Man eventually tried to attack Crush by jumping off the top rope, but Crush caught him and performed the Cranium Crunch to win the match by submission. Main event matches One of the two main event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior. Although Mr. Perfect had claimed that he would be in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the beginning of the match. Savage and the Warrior traded the advantage back and forth, with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but the Warrior caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After the Warrior missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers got back into the ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect walked down the aisle and stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the Warrior after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior, only to attack him when he stood up. The Warrior recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw the Warrior injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable to get back into the ring, so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the Warrior chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together. The next match pitted the Undertaker against Kamala, who was accompanied by his manager, Harvey Wippleman, and his handler, Kim Chee. Kamala attacked before the match but the Undertaker blocked the attack and punched Kamala repeatedly before performing a chop from the top rope on his opponent. The Undertaker attempted the same move again, but Wippleman knocked the Undertaker off the rope. Kamala knocked the Undertaker outside the ring, where the Undertaker attacked Wippleman and Kim Chee. Back inside the ring, the Undertaker gained the advantage by executing a chokeslam and a clothesline. When the Undertaker attempted his signature move, the Tombstone Piledriver, Kim Chee ran into the ring and hit the Undertaker with a pith helmet. As a result, Kamala was disqualified and the Undertaker won the match. Kamala kept on attacking and hit Undertaker with a series of splashes and seemingly left his opponent unconscious. When the Undertaker suddenly sat up and looked directly at the Ugandan Giant, Kamala, Wippleman and Kim Chee panicked and fled ringside with The Undertaker and Paul Bearer slowly walking in pursuit. Next, Tatanka defeated The Berzerker by pinfall. This match was originally scheduled as part of the pay-per-view. Due to time constraints it was cut from the PPV lineup in post-production. The match, however, later aired on WWF Prime Time Wrestling. On the Silver Vision home video release in the UK, this match was placed after the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match. Up next, Rowdy Roddy Piper joined the Balmoral Highlanders in playing Scotland the Brave on the bagpipes. The event concluded with the second main event, a contest for the Intercontinental Championship between champion Bret Hart and challenger \"British Bulldog\" Davey Boy Smith, who was accompanied by the reigning Commonwealth Heavyweight Boxing Champion, London native Lennox Lewis. In the opening minutes, Hart used his technical wrestling abilities and Smith relied on his power advantage. Hart got control of the match with a reverse atomic drop and a Samoan drop. Smith came back with a monkey flip, but Hart regained the advantage with a bulldog and a plancha. Smith eventually recovered and tried to pin Hart with a back slide. Hart escaped the pin attempt and wore Smith down with sleeper holds. Smith gained the advantage, however, and used power moves to control the match, including a running powerslam and a variety of suplexes. Hart managed to place Smith in the Sharpshooter, Hart's signature submission hold. Smith escaped the hold, however, and threw Hart against the ropes. While running back at Smith, Hart attempted a sunset flip. Smith countered the move and pinned Hart to win the Intercontinental Championship. Immediately after the match, Hart refused to shake Smith's hand. He soon changed his mind, however, and hugged Smith as well as Diana Hart, who was celebrating with her husband. Writing in his autobiography Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling, Hart recalled that prior to the match, he had been unable to contact Smith to prepare for the match as Smith had spent the few weeks before the match smoking crack cocaine with Jim Neidhart. Reception According to the WWF, the 80,355 people were in attendance for SummerSlam 1992, which at that time was behind only WrestleMania III in attendance (though has since been surpassed by future events). WrestleMania III was said to have attracted 93,173 crowd. However some observers place the attendance for WrestleMania III closer to 78,000, which makes the crowd for SummerSlam 1992 arguably the biggest verified crowd in WWF history until WrestleMania 29 in 2013. The event has received positive reviews from a variety of sources. RD Reynolds has called it \"a huge success\". In particular, the Intercontinental Championship match has been called \"one of the greatest matches of all time\". Pro Wrestling Illustrated named it the Match of the Year in the magazine's year-end issue, and WWE has called the match the greatest moment in SummerSlam history. Bret Hart has also named it as his favorite match of all time. The WWF collected $2,200,000 in revenue from admissions, up from $445,000 the previous year. The company also sold $1,456,203 in merchandise at SummerSlam, which is the largest amount of merchandise revenue at a WWF event. The buyrate for the event was 1.5, down from 2.7 at SummerSlam 1991 but higher than the 1.3 buyrate at SummerSlam 1993. SummerSlam 1992 was released on VHS format on September 24, 1992. While the US release only included the eight matches shown on pay-per-view, the UK release included all eleven matches including the three dark matches. On October 3, 2005 in the United Kingdom, the event was released on DVD, packaged together with SummerSlam 1993, as part of the WWE Tagged Classics line. The event was again later released as part of WWE's SummerSlam Anthology boxed DVD set. The anthology was released on August 5, 2008 in North America and was released on October 6, 2008 in the United Kingdom. However, the version that is included with the Anthology is only the 8 match PPV broadcast version. Aftermath Randy Savage, who continued to sell his supposedly injured leg, lost the title to Ric Flair at a television taping on September 1, 1992 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. During the match Flair received help not only from Mr Perfect but also from newcomer Razor Ramon, igniting a feud between Savage and Ramon. Bret Hart claimed in a 2014 interview that WWF owner Vince McMahon had worked out the title-change match with Flair and Savage before hand, and that he was angry when they returned to the dressing room after the match because they had failed to do much of what was agreed upon. McMahon was so angry that he actually sent Bobby Heenan out to signal that the match be aborted and then made them go straight back out and restart the whole match. After producing much the same match that they had immediately prior, McMahon allegedly threw his headset onto the table and stormed off in frustration. WWF writers had originally planned that the Ultimate Warrior should be the one to accept Mr Perfect's services, turning heel in the process of winning the title and that, as new champion, he would further feud with Savage. After these plans were scrapped due to the Warrior's refusal to turn heel, the two were scheduled to face Flair and Ramon at Survivor Series 1992. However, as the Warrior quit the promotion on November 21, his spot was surprisingly offered to Mr. Perfect, who accepted it in spite of Flair, thereby turning face and initiating a feud with Flair which culminated in Flair leaving the WWF in January 1993. Shawn Michaels, who had originally been booked to win the Intercontinental Championship from Bret Hart at SummerSlam, won the title from Davey Boy Smith on October 27 (the match would air on the November 14, 1992 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event XXXI). Michaels and Sherri continued their on-screen relationship after SummerSlam. Sherri claimed to have created the rivalry with Martel to test Michaels' love for her. Their relationship deteriorated, though when Michaels pulled Sherri in front of him to protect himself from an attack by his former tag team partner, Marty Jannetty on the October 31 episode of WWF Superstars. This led to confrontations between Sherri and Michaels at Royal Rumble 1993 and WrestleMania IX. The Undertaker continued to feud with Kamala and Harvey Wippleman. The two wrestlers faced each other again at Survivor Series 1992 in a coffin match, which the Undertaker won. Wippleman gained revenge by introducing Giant Gonzalez (and later Mr. Hughes), with whom the Undertaker feuded through 1993. Upset about the amount of his pay for appearing at SummerSlam, Kevin Wacholz (Nailz) confronted WWF owner Vince McMahon after Survivor Series 1992. According to reports, he legitimately attacked McMahon. As a result, Nailz was fired from the WWF. He briefly appeared in rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as the Prisoner but was released after the WWF sued WCW because of The Prisoner's similarity to the Nailz character. The anger between Wacholz and McMahon spilled over into McMahon's 1994 trial, in which McMahon was accused of distributing steroids to wrestlers. Although Wacholz testified against McMahon, his statements, which included, \"I hate Vince McMahon's guts\" ultimately proved harmful to the prosecution's case.

{"text": "The 1993 SummerSlam was the sixth annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 30, 1993, at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan and featured ten televised matches. All three of the WWF's then-active championships were defended at the event. The main event saw Lex Luger challenge Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. On the undercard, The Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner) defended the WWF Tag Team Championship against The Heavenly Bodies (Jimmy Del Ray and Tom Prichard), and Shawn Michaels defended the WWF Intercontinental Championship against Mr. Perfect. In addition to the title matches, Bret Hart and Jerry Lawler were scheduled to wrestle to settle their feud and determine who would be named \"Undisputed King of the World Wrestling Federation.\" Production Background SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\", and one of the \"Big Five\", along with King of the Ring that was established in June 1993. It has since been considered WWE’s second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1993 event was the sixth event in the SummerSlam chronology and was scheduled to be held on August 30, 1993, at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Storylines Two of the matches at SummerSlam 1993 were a result of Razor Ramon's loss to The Kid (later the 1-2-3 Kid) on the May 17, 1993 edition of Monday Night Raw. Following Ramon's loss to the newcomer, Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) teased Ramon about the match. DiBiase offered Ramon a job as a servant, which Ramon angrily refused. Ramon began teaming with the 1-2-3 Kid for a series of matches against Money Inc. DiBiase asked for a singles match against the Kid, and the Kid accepted the challenge. Ramon helped the Kid win the match by distracting DiBiase. It was decided that the feuds would be settled in two singles matches at SummerSlam, with Ramon facing DiBiase and Schyster facing the 1-2-3 Kid. The match between the Steiner Brothers and The Heavenly Bodies received little buildup. The Bodies were a successful tag team in Jim Cornette's Smoky Mountain Wrestling, and an interpromotional agreement allowed them to challenge for the WWF Tag Team Championship. The rivalry between Shawn Michaels and Mr. Perfect began at WrestleMania IX. During a fight after the match between Lex Luger and Mr. Perfect, Shawn Michaels appeared and attacked Perfect. Mr. Perfect gained revenge by distracting Michaels at the May 17, 1993 edition of Monday Night Raw, allowing Marty Jannetty to pin Michaels and win the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Michaels regained the belt the following month with the help of his new bodyguard, Diesel. Bret Hart and Jerry Lawler had a heated feud, stemming from Lawler interrupting Hart's victory ceremony at the 1993 King of the Ring tournament. Lawler insisted that he was the true king of the WWF and attacked Hart. The feud intensified as Lawler taunted and attacked Bret's family, including his parents and his younger brother Owen. According to a story relayed by Bret Hart on the TSN sports show Off The Record, Hart was originally supposed to wrestle Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. From Hart’s explanation of matters, the reason the match did not happen was because Hogan changed his mind, as he was supposedly not happy with the planned finish. As a result, Hogan lost the belt to Yokozuna at King of the Ring 1993 instead. However, this has never been officially explained by WWE (then WWF), and is part of Professional Wrestling lore on the Internet. Eventually Bret Hart and Yokozuna would have a rematch at WrestleMania X, where Hart’s storyline loss of the title was avenged, when he beat Yokozuna to start his second reign as WWF Champion. Marty Jannetty was originally supposed to face Rick Martel, but Ludvig Borga replaced Martel well before the match. The match received little buildup, although Borga appeared in several vignettes leading up to the match. He criticized the United States for such reasons as its pollution. Jannetty vowed to defend America's pride in his match against Borga. The buildup for the match between Giant Gonzalez and The Undertaker began after the Undertaker defeated Kamala in a Coffin match at Survivor Series 1992. Kamala's manager Harvey Wippleman vowed revenge and introduced Gonzalez at Royal Rumble 1993, with Gonzalez attacking and eliminating the Undertaker. Gonzalez and the Undertaker wrestled at WrestleMania IX, and Gonzalez knocked the Undertaker unconscious with a chloroform-soaked rag. The feud intensified when Wippleman, Gonzalez and Mr. Hughes attacked the Undertaker and his manager, Paul Bearer. They stole the urn, the supposed source of the Undertaker's strength, and used it to assault Paul Bearer, who was not seen again until SummerSlam. The feud came to a head at SummerSlam in a Rest In Peace match. The six-man match at SummerSlam was originally supposed to be a mixed tag-team match between the team of Tatanka and Sherri Martel and the team of Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon. However, Luna broke her arm and Sherri left the WWF in July 1993, however, forcing the WWF to change the match. Two reasons have been given for Sherri's departure: her decision to enroll in cosmetology school and failed drug tests. As a result, Tatanka teamed with The Smoking Gunns and Bigelow teamed with The Headshrinkers. The Gunns and Headshrinkers were rivals in the tag team division but had no real storyline. The feud between Bigelow and Tatanka originated when Tatanka came to the help of Sherri, who had interrupted an interview with Bigelow. Subsequently, Bigelow ambushed Tatanka and cut some of the hair Tatanka had dyed red as a tribute to his Lumbee heritage. Lex Luger's rivalry with Yokozuna began on July 4 at the Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge on the deck of the USS Intrepid. After several wrestlers and other athletes attempted to body slam Yokozuna, Luger arrived in a helicopter. He was able to body slam Yokozuna, which led to a title shot at SummerSlam. To build support for Luger, the WWF had him ride across the country in a bus named the Lex Express. Yokozuna's spokesperson, Jim Cornette, agreed to the match, but he made Lex Luger agree to two conditions. Luger would not receive a rematch if he lost, and he had to wear protective padding over the steel plate in his forearm. Event The pay-per-view took place in front of a crowd of 23,954 at the Palace of Auburn Hills. Before the event aired on PPV, \"The Rocket\" Owen Hart defeated longtime jobber Barry Horowitz in a dark match. The first televised match was Razor Ramon versus Ted DiBiase. DiBiase got off to a quick start by attacking Ramon before the match began. Ramon quickly turned the match around with several clotheslines. DiBiase regained control before untying a turnbuckle cover. Ramon won the match after ramming DiBiase's head into the exposed turnbuckle and using the Razor's Edge to get the pin. The Steiner Brothers were the audience favorites in the WWF Tag Team Championship match, as they were defending the belts in their hometown. Before the match began, The Heavenly Bodies attacked them. When the match began, the Bodies executed several double-team maneuvers on Rick Steiner. Scott tagged in and took control of the match. The Bodies soon regained the advantage, and Jim Cornette got involved by hitting Scott in the throat with a tennis racket. Rick tagged back in and hit several Steiner-Lines before Prichard attacked him with Cornette's tennis racket. Del Ray accidentally hit Prichard with a moonsault, however, allowing Scott to hit a Frankensteiner and Rick to get the pin. The match between Shawn Michaels and Mr. Perfect began with a series of wrestling holds. The match remained primarily technical until Diesel distracted Perfect, allowing Michaels to superkick him in the face. Michaels worked on Perfect's injured back until Perfect took control of the match. After a series of attacks on Michaels, Perfect used the Perfect Plex. Diesel pulled him out of the ring and threw him into the steel ring steps, however, allowing Michaels to win by countout. Irwin R. Schyster remained in control for the majority of his match against the 1-2-3 Kid. Although the Kid hit several kicks, Schyster regained control every time. Schyster used his usual abdominal stretch while using the ring ropes for leverage before the Kid made a brief comeback by hitting a moonsault. Schyster hit a Write Off, however, and got the pin. Bret Hart came to the ring for his match with Jerry Lawler. Lawler, however, appeared on crutches and claimed that he had been injured in a car accident. He announced that his court jester, Doink the Clown (portrayed by Matt Osborne), would wrestle Hart in his place. Doink threw a bucket of water on Bret's brother, Bruce Hart, prompting Bret to attack Doink outside of the ring. The match consisted of angry brawling until Doink slowed the pace with a couple of submission holds. After Doink missed a Whoopie Cushion attempt, Bret took full control of the match and locked Doink in the Sharpshooter. With Doink in the sharpshooter, Lawler then attacked Bret with a crutch, revealing that he was not injured and thus causing an unofficial disqualification (no official announcement was made). WWF President Jack Tunney came to the ring and had Howard Finkel announce that Lawler would be given a lifetime ban if he refused to compete in the scheduled match. The match between Lawler and Hart consisted almost exclusively of brawling. The two attacked each other with a milk pail and crutches and traded punches and kicks. Bret used Lawler's signature move, the piledriver, before putting him in the Sharpshooter. Lawler submitted, but Bret refused to release him for three and a half minutes. The referee then reversed his decision and gave the victory and title of \"Undisputed King of the World Wrestling Federation\" to Lawler. Ludvig Borga dominated the majority of a squash match against Marty Jannetty. He attacked Jannetty immediately with a series of punches and knees. Jannetty managed a couple of brief comebacks but was unable to mount a serious offense. Borga used his strength to control the match and won the match by submission with a backbreaker. Harvey Wippleman was at ringside with the urn as the Undertaker faced Giant Gonzalez. The two wrestlers brawled, using the ring steps and steel chairs. Halfway through the match, Paul Bearer appeared, carrying a black wreath. He attacked Wippleman and took back the urn. The Undertaker quickly took control of the match, attacking Gonzalez with a flying clothesline to win by pinfall. After the match, Gonzalez turned on Wippleman and attacked him with a chokeslam. The next match on the card was the Six-Man tag team match. The Headshrinkers' manager Afa interfered by attacking Billy Gunn outside the ring. At one point, Tatanka looked like he was gaining control, as he began his usual war dance. Bigelow kicked him in the back of the head, however, to end his momentum. Near the end of the match, Bigelow and the Headshrinkers each climbed the turnbuckles to attempt simultaneous diving headbutts, but Tatanka rolled out of the way. Tatanka seized the opportunity and pinned Samu for the win. Before the main event, Kiotika Suzuki sang the Japanese national anthem. Akio Sato, formerly a member of The Orient Express, was the flag bearer for Yokozuna. Randy Savage then introduced Aaron Neville, who sang the American anthem. The main event began with a stare down. Luger gained the early advantage and managed to knock Yokozuna down by kicking the ring ropes into Yokozuna's groin. Luger tried to bodyslam Yokozuna, but the sumo wrestler's weight was too much. Yokozuna knocked him out of the ring and choked him. Yokozuna had his manager, Mr. Fuji, throw him a salt bucket, which he used to attack Luger. Yokozuna wore Luger down, and after a brief comeback by the all-American, hit a leg drop on Luger and pulled him to the corner for a Banzai Drop. After Yokozuna missed, Luger succeeded in bodyslamming Yokozuna, and he attacked Mr. Fuji when the manager tried to get involved. Luger knocked Yokozuna out of the ring with a forearm smash, and followed this up by attacking Jim Cornette. Yokozuna was counted out, but he retained the title because championships only change hands only by pinfall or submission. Several faces came to the ring to celebrate with Luger as red, white and blue balloons fell from the ceiling to celebrate the victory. Aftermath The SummerSlam match was DiBiase's final appearance as a WWF wrestler. He injured his neck and back in January 1994 and was forced to retire from wrestling. Meanwhile, Ramon received a push in Fall 1993 that led to the first of four Intercontinental championships. The Heavenly Bodies did not become serious contenders to the tag team title, and the Steiners soon began a feud with The Quebecers, a new team in the WWF. Shawn Michaels was suspended in late 1993 and forced to vacate the Intercontinental Championship, while Mr. Perfect began a feud with Diesel. The WWF planned to have Perfect and Diesel face each other as part of an elimination match at Survivor Series 1993, but Mr. Perfect was replaced by Randy Savage at the last minute. Mr. Perfect would not wrestle another pay per view match for the company until Royal Rumble 2002. The match between Hart and Doink was significant for a couple of reasons. It marked Doink's final match as a heel, as he turned on Jerry Lawler shortly after the match. In addition, Matt Osborne, who had portrayed Doink since the character's creation, was fired that fall because of drug problems. The feud between Jerry Lawler and Bret Hart remained unsettled and led to several storylines over the next two years. The final pay per view event featuring this feud was SummerSlam 1995, which saw Hart beat Lawler's \"dentist\" Isaac Yankem, D.D.S. Borga received a main event push after his SummerSlam match. After the event, he confronted Luger in the locker room. This began a feud that led to a match between the All-Americans and Foreign Fanatics at Survivor Series 1993. Luger continued to work as a main event wrestler, although he never won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. He competed in another match with Yokozuna at WrestleMania X after co-winning the 1994 Royal Rumble but was again unsuccessful in taking the belt from Yokozuna.

{"text": "Pos Malaysia Berhad (, ) is a postal delivery service in Malaysia, with history dating back to early 1800s. Services Pos Malaysia provides postal and related services, namely: Standard Mail (Flexipack Domestic, Standard Mail, Non-Standard Mail, Postcards, Mel Rakyat, Pos Ekspres, Pos Daftar, Pos Solutions). Courier, Express & Parcels CEP (Same Day Delivery, Next Day Delivery, Time Certain Service, Pos Parcel, Pos Ekspres, Pos Laju Prepaid Pack, On-Demand Pick-up, Prepaid Envelopes/Boxes). Retail (Bill payments, driving rketplace). The company holds an exclusive concession to provide mail services through its network of over 926 branches and mini post offices across Malaysia. About History The history of Pos Malaysia Berhad can be traced back to the early 1800s with the establishment of postal services first in the Straits Settlements in Penang, Malacca and Singapore expanding through the rest of Malaya by the early 20th century. Letters were then conveyed through dispatch riders or special messengers. Instead of postage stamps, fees were collected when letters were handed in at the Post Office. Letters posted were given a receipt. The system later changed when the Indian stamps overprinted with crown and Straits' stamps overprinted with dollars and cents were introduced in 1867. The first inaugural set of postage stamps was introduced in 1901. The Federated Malay States Posts and Telegraphs Department was formally created on 1 January 1905 with the merger of the postal and telegraph services of Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan, and Pahang. A Malayan Postage Union was established in 1907 that instituted universal postage rates for the Federated Malay States, the Straits Settlements, and Johor. Kedah, Kelantan, and Trengganu joined in 1909 when they transferred from Thailand to British protection. It also started as a medium for the transmission of letters, newspapers, and business documents. The postal service soon evolved into a multiple services provider. It began to venture into parcel delivery, registrations, insurance service, transaction of money (postal order & money order), and investment of funds (Post Office Saving Bank). The postal service, then known as Jabatan Perkhidmatan Pos – Postal Services Department (PSD), also began to take over numerous services on behalf of the Government departments. It started to collect payment of electricity bills, sale of dog licences, payment of pensions, sale of television licence and others. In 1992, Pos Malaysia Berhad was corporated from the PSD. In September 2001, Pos Malaysia Berhad was listed on the then Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (now known as Bursa Malaysia Berhad) through a reverse takeover of a Philio Allied Berhad assuming its listing status. Today, Pos Malaysia has many Strategic Business Units - POS Laju, POS, Data Pos, POS ArRahnu, POS Digicert, POS Solutions & POS Online. Origins and Evolution Pos Malaysia, the parent company of Pos Laju, has its roots in the early postal services established during the Straits Settlements era in the 1800s. The mail system back then primarily served to facilitate communications between the British colonies. After Malaysia gained independence in 1957, the mail system was nationalized, leading to the establishment of Jabatan Perkhidmatan Pos Malaysia or the Malaysian Postal Services Department. Formation of Pos Laju Pos Laju was officially launched in 1985 as the express courier arm of Pos Malaysia, focusing on time-sensitive delivery of documents and parcels. The formation of Pos Laju marked a significant milestone as it heralded a new era in the Malaysian postal and courier industry, with emphasis on speed, reliability, and coverage. Expansion and Services Over the years, Pos Laju has significantly expanded its services and network, establishing itself as Malaysia’s leading courier service provider. It offers a diverse range of services including express parcel delivery, logistics, freight forwarding, and e-commerce solutions.

{"text": "Philmore was a Christian rock band that formed in Tulsa, Oklahoma in the late 1990s, and was active until 2005. The band's original lineup consisted of brothers Justin (lead guitar and vocals) and Kayle Greiman (bass) with drummer Brett Schoneman. Career Philmore's self-titled debut album was released on Five Minute Walk Records in June 2000, featuring the track \"Our Finest Hour\", and a cover of Bon Jovi's \"Living on a Prayer\". The inside cover features a photograph of the band wearing mirror sunglasses and jeans with holes in them. Philmore were heavily influenced by MXPX, and their music combined punk rock with a 1980s edge of pop and glam metal. Justin Greiman's vocals were unusually high for a male vocalist, leading to comparisons with \"Weird Al\" Yankovic. Philmore toured the United States extensively after the release of their first album, touring with Relient K, Bleach, Holland in the Back to the Few Tour and Watashi Wa, among others. In July 2002, their second album, The Bare Truth About Philmore, was released. This album was somewhat softer-edged than the first, and at the same time, was not explicitly Christian. They continued touring, but their popularity began to decrease. Schoneman left the band in 2001 and became a realtor in Iowa, and was replaced by Sean Donnelly in 2003. The band made a third CD in April 2005 called Demolition, then went dormant after Donnelly left the band in August 2005. Justin Greiman owns a photography company, while Kayle is now a fireman.

{"text": "The 1994 SummerSlam was the seventh annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 29, 1994, at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, which had opened eleven days earlier. Eight matches were contested at the event, including one dark match held before the live broadcast. The pay-per-view had two main events. The first pitted Owen Hart against his brother Bret Hart in a steel cage match. Bret won the match, but the storyline feud escalated after Owen and his brother-in-law Jim Neidhart attacked Bret after the match. The other main event saw The Undertaker defeat an impostor Undertaker (portrayed by Brian Lee). The undercard included a match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship between Diesel and Razor Ramon, which Ramon won to regain the title. The other major angle going into SummerSlam was a feud in which Tatanka accused Lex Luger of joining the Million Dollar Corporation, a stable of heel wrestlers. This storyline turned out to be a swerve, as Tatanka was revealed to have secretly joined the corporation. Production Background SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1994 event was the seventh event in the SummerSlam chronology and was held on Monday, August 29, 1994, at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, which had opened eleven days earlier. Storylines Kwang and Adam Bomb were both managed by Harvey Wippleman. On May 28, 1994, a King of the Ring qualifying match between Bomb and the 1–2–3 Kid was televised on WWF Superstars. The angle saw The Kid win after Kwang attempted to interfere on Bomb's behalf. Kwang accidentally spat green mist in Bomb's face, allowing the Kid to get the victory. Wippleman had Bomb and Kwang work as a tag team, but problems continued to develop between the two. The pair split after an argument cost them the match when they faced the team of the 1–2–3 Kid and \"Sparky\" Thurman Plugg. Bomb and Kwang faced each other on house shows leading up to their dark match at SummerSlam 1994. One of the WWF's main storylines in 1994 was Ted DiBiase's creation of a stable known as the Million Dollar Corporation. That summer, DiBiase purchased the rights to Bam Bam Bigelow's contract from Bigelow's kayfabe girlfriend, Luna Vachon. Irwin R. Schyster, DiBiase's former partner in Money Inc., also joined the stable. Bigelow and Schyster were paired together to challenge for the WWF Tag Team Championship. The night before SummerSlam, The Headshrinkers dropped the belts to Diesel and Shawn Michaels. The match took place as scheduled, but the title was not on the line. In early 1994, the WWF brought back the WWF Women's Championship, which had been deactivated in 1990, and pushed Alundra Blayze to win a championship tournament and defeat all challengers. Luna Vachon was brought in to challenge Blayze in a series of matches but was defeated each time. The storyline then saw Vachon bring in Bull Nakano, a Japanese female wrestler, to gain revenge and challenge Blayze. Razor Ramon had been feuding with Shawn Michaels since being pushed to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship in late 1993. After defeating Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania X, Ramon dropped the belt to Diesel, Michaels' bodyguard. A rematch was scheduled for SummerSlam 1994. Ramon brought in NFL Hall of Famer Walter Payton to be his cornerman and help prevent Michaels from interfering. On the July 11, 1994 edition of Monday Night Raw, a major worked storyline began when Ted DiBiase announced that he had convinced Lex Luger to join the Million Dollar Corporation. Leading up to the pay-per-view, Tatanka confronted Lex Luger on several occasions, criticizing him for \"selling out\" to DiBiase. This led to a kayfabe admission from Luger that he had met with DiBiase, but Luger repeatedly denied having joined the corporation. He agreed to face Tatanka at SummerSlam to settle the argument. Jeff Jarrett and Mabel had no real feud going into SummerSlam. Jarrett played the role of an aspiring country music singer, and Mabel portrayed a rapper. As a result, the WWF promoted the match as part of a \"rap versus country\" rivalry. There was little buildup for the match until Mabel was booked to confront Jarrett on Monday Night Raw the week before SummerSlam. He tried to provoke Jarrett into a fight, but Jarrett walked away through the crowd to avoid Mabel. The biggest storyline at SummerSlam began at the 1993 Survivor Series when Owen Hart was eliminated from the “Hart Brothers vs. Shawn Michaels and His Knights” elimination match due to miscommunication within the Hart team. Bret Hart was walking along the ring apron when Owen ran into him, causing Owen to lose his focus and be pinned by Michaels. After the match, Owen interrupted his brothers’ victory celebration to verbally attack Bret. The brothers reunited over the Christmas holidays and focused on challenging The Quebecers for the World Tag Team Championship at Royal Rumble 1994. During the match, Bret kayfabe injured his knee, which eventually caused the referee to stop the match. Owen then turned on Bret by kicking his injured leg and leaving him lying in the ring. Bret jobbed to Owen in the opening match at WrestleMania X but defeated Yokozuna later in the pay-per-view to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Jim Neidhart, Bret and Owen's real-life brother-in-law, became involved at King of the Ring 1994 by aligning himself with Owen Hart. To settle the feud, Bret and Owen were booked to face each other in a Steel cage match at SummerSlam. After losing a Casket match to Yokozuna at the 1994 Royal Rumble, The Undertaker did not appear in the WWF for several months. In reality, he was given time off to allow a back injury to heal. The WWF foreshadowed his return by airing videos of people who claimed to have seen The Undertaker. Eventually, DiBiase, who introduced The Undertaker to the WWF in 1990, claimed to have brought The Undertaker back to the WWF. but Paul Bearer informed him that DiBiase's Undertaker was an impostor and that Bearer had located the true Undertaker. This led to a match at SummerSlam pitting the two Undertakers against each other. In the buildup to the match, Leslie Nielsen performed short segments trying to solve the mystery of how two Undertakers could exist in a spinoff of his roles on Police Squad! and The Naked Gun films. Event In a dark match before the pay-per-view broadcast, Adam Bomb pinned Kwang. As the broadcast opened, the commentators, Vince McMahon (fresh off his federal trial acquittal, one month earlier) and Jerry Lawler, announced that The Headshrinkers had dropped the tag team title to Diesel and Shawn Michaels, and that the belts would not be on the line at SummerSlam. Throughout the broadcast, Nielsen and his co-star from The Naked Gun, George Kennedy, appeared backstage in skits trying to solve the mystery of the two Undertakers. Preliminary matches In the first televised match, The Headshrinkers were accompanied by managers Afa and Captain Lou Albano, and Bigelow and I.R.S. came to the ring with Ted DiBiase. Bigelow began the match by overpowering Fatu, but The Headshrinkers gained the advantage when Bigelow missed an Avalanche attempt. Schyster tagged in, and Bigelow pulled down the ropes to allow I.R.S. to throw Samu out of the ring. Outside the ring, Bigelow attacked Fatu with Schyster's briefcase. Samu performed a diving headbutt, but he was unable to get the pinfall. Ted DiBiase distracted the referee, which prompted Albano to protest. Meanwhile, Afa entered the ring to attack Bigelow. The referee saw Afa in the ring and awarded the match to Bigelow and Schyster as the result of a disqualification. The following match saw Nakano challenging Blayze for the Women's Championship. Nakano used her size to perform such moves as leg drops and several submission holds. Blayze countered with aerial maneuvers like a hurricanrana and a spinning heel kick. Vachon got involved by choking Blayze while Nakano distracted the referee. The match ended when Nakano missed a diving leg drop, allowing Blayze to pin her for the win. Early in the next match, Diesel threw Razor Ramon out of the ring, allowing Shawn Michaels to remove the turnbuckle padding. Walter Payton argued with Michaels about his interference, drawing the referee's attention. Michaels seized the opportunity to attack Ramon behind the referee's back. Diesel used two big boots and a series of submission holds to maintain the advantage. When he tried to throw Ramon into the unprotected turnbuckle, Payton pointed out the missing padding to the referee, who stood in the way to prevent the move. Soon after, Diesel tried to ram Ramon into the turnbuckle, but Ramon escaped and pushed Diesel into the turnbuckle. Ramon kept his momentum by performing a bulldog, a scoop slam, and a superplex. When Michaels tried to get involved again, Payton chased him around the outside of the ring. While the referee was distracted, Michaels entered the ring and tried to perform a superkick while Diesel held Ramon. Ramon moved, causing Michaels to kick Diesel instead. Ramon pinned Diesel to win the match and regain the Intercontinental Championship. The match between Tatanka and Lex Luger began with the two wrestlers arguing. Luger relied on his power by punching and performing a shoulderblock. Tatanka focused on wearing Luger down with a wristlock and an armbar. After Luger performed a vertical suplex, Tatanka recovered and powerslammed Luger. Eventually, DiBiase came to ringside with a bag of money. As Luger yelled at DiBiase, Tatanka performed a schoolboy roll-up for the victory. After the match, Tatanka revealed that he had joined DiBiase's corporation. Tatanka attacked Luger and used the Million Dollar Dream, DiBiase's signature move, on Luger before leaving with DiBiase. Mabel used his weight advantage to gain the early advantage in his match with Jeff Jarrett. Jarrett gained momentum when he tripped Mabel and performed a fist drop and two double axe handles from the ropes. On two occasions, Jarrett jumped on Mabel's back to perform sleeper holds, but Mabel backed him into the corner to escape both times. Mabel attempted to perform a splash from the second rope but missed. Jarrett attempted a sunset flip, which Mabel tried to counter by sitting on him. Jarrett moved out of the way and quickly pinned Mabel to win the match. In a reference to the 1994 Major League Baseball strike, Abe \"Knuckleball\" Schwartz was shown picketing in the crowd with an \"I'm on strike!\" sign. Main event matches As Owen Hart entered the steel cage for his WWF Championship match with his brother Bret, he immediately attacked Bret. Bret gained the advantage by performing a DDT. Owen kicked Bret in the head and tried to escape from the cage. The brothers both tried to climb over the cage several times, but neither would let the other escape. The match consisted mainly of brawling, including a couple of occasions when the two exchanged punches while standing on the top rope. Owen climbed over the cage, but Bret dragged him back in by pulling Owen's hair. Owen performed a piledriver on Bret, but Bret came back by throwing Owen into the bars of the cage. As Owen tried to escape, Bret suplexed him back into the ring from the top of the cage. Owen recovered and performed the Sharpshooter on Bret, but Bret escaped and used the same move on Owen. The match ended after Bret threw Owen's head into the steel cage and Owen's leg became trapped between the cage's bars. Bret climbed over the top of the cage and dropped to the floor to win the match and retain the title. After the match, Jim Neidhart attacked Davey Boy Smith, another brother-in-law of the Hart brothers. Neidhart padlocked the cage, and he and Owen attacked Bret until the other Harts could intervene. The second main event match had Bearer's Undertaker fighting DiBiase's Undertaker. After DiBiase's Undertaker walked to the ring, Bearer appeared by himself while pushing a casket to the ring. He reached inside the casket and pulled out an urn, which had a light inside it when Bearer removed its lid. Bearer's Undertaker came to the ring and confronted DiBiase's Undertaker. Both wrestlers were wearing identical costumes, but Bearer's Undertaker wore purple gloves while DiBiase's wore grey. Bearer's Undertaker kicked his opponent out of the ring, where DiBiase's Undertaker tried to attack Bearer. DiBiase's Undertaker attempted to perform an arm twist ropewalk chop, but Bearer's Undertaker stopped him and performed the move. DiBiase's Undertaker then performed a chokeslam and a Tombstone piledriver. As he tried for another Tombstone piledriver, Bearer's Undertaker reversed it and performed the move. Bearer's Undertaker then performed two more Tombstone piledrivers before getting the pinfall victory. A group of people dressed as druids came to ringside, put DiBiase's Undertaker in the casket, and took the casket away. Aftermath DiBiase continued to manage his corporation until he left the WWF in 1996, but none of his wrestlers won a championship under his management. Tatanka and Luger continued to feud until they faced each other as part of an elimination match at the 1994 Survivor Series. Bigelow was later \"fired\" from the stable, leading to a feud with DiBiase's wrestlers. Nakano was booked to win the Women's Championship on November 27, 1994. After Blayze won it back the following spring, Nakano disappeared from the WWF without mention and joined World Championship Wrestling. Bret Hart was scheduled to defend his title against Bob Backlund at Survivor Series 1994. The stipulations stated that the only way to win was to force the person in your opponent's corner to throw a towel into the ring. Davey Boy Smith was in Bret's corner, while Owen Hart was in Backlund's corner. Smith chased Owen around the ring until Smith suffered a kayfabe injury, leaving nobody to throw in Bret's towel. As Backlund performed the crossface chickenwing on Bret, Owen pretended to show remorse. He convinced his mother, Helen, to throw in Bret's towel. After Backlund was awarded the belt, Owen celebrated his success in costing Bret the title. At Survivor Series 1994, the storyline with Michaels and Diesel saw Michaels accidentally superkick Diesel once again. As a result, Diesel turned on Michaels, becoming a face and vacating the Tag Team Championship. Three days later, Bob Backlund put Diesel over by dropping his WWF World Heavyweight Championship in a match that lasted eight seconds. Diesel feuded with Michaels and defended the belt against him at WrestleMania XI. DiBiase's Undertaker was not seen again, but the wrestler portraying him, Brian Lee, returned to the WWF in 1997 as Chainz. Bearer's Undertaker gained revenge against Yokozuna at Survivor Series 1994 by defeating him in a casket match. To prevent interference, Chuck Norris was at ringside as a special guest enforcer. This was the last SummerSlam to take place on a Monday.

{"text": "The 1995 SummerSlam was the eighth annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 27, 1995, at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A total of nine matches were contested at the event. The main event that was for the WWF Championship competed between Diesel and King Mabel. Diesel retained the championship, pinning Mabel after performing a clothesline off the second rope. There were three matches on the undercard that had more build-up than other matches: The Undertaker defeated Kama in a Casket match; Bret Hart defeated Isaac Yankem by disqualification after Yankem and Jerry Lawler attacked Hart while Hart was in the \"hangman\" position. The third match on the undercard that had significant build-up was Shawn Michaels versus Razor Ramon in a feud for the WWF Intercontinental Championship. The two faced off in a Ladder match, with Michaels retaining the title. The pay-per-view received a 0.9 buyrate, equivalent to approximately 205,000 buys in 1995 (1.0 equated to roughly 230,000 homes in the domestic market that year). Although this was up on the buyrate for the In Your House 2 pay-per-view which took place the previous month, the buyrate was down on the 1994 SummerSlam event, which received a 1.3 buyrate. Summerslam 1995 was the last WWF PPV before the Monday Night Wars era of September 4, 1995, to March 26, 2001, during which WWF's Raw and World Championship Wrestling's Nitro competed for ratings in a weekly Monday night time slot, which is now widely seen as the \"golden age\" of pro-wrestling. Production Background SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1995 event was the eighth event in the SummerSlam chronology and the first to take place on a Sunday as the previous seven events aired on a Monday. It was scheduled to be held on August 27, 1995, at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Storylines The most prominent feud heading into the event was between WWF Champion Diesel and King of the Ring, King Mabel (accompanied by his manager and tag team partner, Sir Mo). King Mabel earned his title by winning the King of the Ring tournament. During Diesel's Lumberjack match with Sycho Sid at In Your House 2, King Mabel (who was one of the lumberjacks) intervened, tossing Diesel into the ring steps. Despite Mabel's interference, Diesel kept the title, pinning Sid after a big boot. On the August 7 episode of Monday Night Raw, Diesel faced Sir Mo. Mabel appeared at ringside, distracting Diesel. Moments later, Shawn Michaels came ringside to support Diesel. After Diesel won the match, Mabel attacked him with a clothesline and a leg drop. Mabel then attacked Michaels. On the last Raw before SummerSlam, commentator Vince McMahon interviewed Diesel about his SummerSlam title defense. Halfway through the interview, Davey Boy Smith appeared and suggested he and Diesel team for a match against Men on a Mission (Mabel and Mo). During the match, Smith turned on Diesel and sided with Men on a Mission, leading to a three-on-one assault of the champion. The feud between The Undertaker and Kama (a member of Ted Dibiase's Million Dollar Corporation) began at WrestleMania XI. The Undertaker's manager was Paul Bearer, and Kama's manager was Ted DiBiase. Undertaker was portrayed as the face, and Kama as the heel. At WrestleMania XI, during Undertaker's match with King Kong Bundy, Kama ran out to the ring, attacked Bearer, and stole the urn (an object which, in storylines, gives The Undertaker supernatural power) for DiBiase. Immediately afterward, Kama declared (in an interview with Jim Ross) his intention to melt down the urn. The urn was revealed to have become a gold necklace, first worn by Kama prior to his match with Scott Taylor on the April 10 episode of Raw. On the April 23 episode of Action Zone, The Undertaker defeated Sycho Sid, another member of The Million Dollar Corporation. On the May 7 episode of Wrestling Challenge, a black wreath was left at ringside for Kama. Kama attacked the wreath and, after defeating Buck Zumhofe, stuffed part of it into Zumhofe's mouth. Another black wreath was left at ringside for Kama on the June 12 Raw. After defeating jobber David Haskins, Kama again attacked the wreath, only to realise it was a mannequin. Both The Undertaker and Kama participated in the 1995 King of the Ring tournament. On the pay-per-view, a black wreath was ringside for the whole of Kama's quarterfinal match with Shawn Michaels, which ended in a draw. Toward the end of The Undertaker's quarterfinal contest with Mabel, Undertaker was thrown into the referee. While the referee was down, Kama interfered by kicking Undertaker in the face. Mabel followed up with a leg drop, pinning Undertaker to win the match. The Undertaker chased Kama backstage after the bout. The two continued to wrestle together in matches at house shows, with the two facing each other in preparation for their SummerSlam bout. Wreaths continued to be left ringside during Kama's matches, and Kama continued to attack them. On the August 21, 1995 Raw, (storyline) WWF president Gorilla Monsoon announced the match between Undertaker and Kama would be a casket match. An undercard feud involved Shawn Michaels and the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Michaels had won the title by pinning Jeff Jarrett at In Your House 2. At that event, Michaels was also a \"lumberjack\" in the WWF Title match between Diesel and Sycho Sid. He performed a double axe handle off the top rope onto Sid on the outside of the ring, helping Diesel retain the title. A few months prior, Sid had powerbombed Michaels three times, after Shawn blamed Sid for costing him the WWF World Heavyweight Title at WrestleMania XI sidelining him for six weeks with injuries. On the July 24 Raw, Sid vowed revenge on Michaels. That night, commentator Jerry Lawler stated his own desire for a shot at Michaels' title. A match between Sid and Michaels was scheduled for SummerSlam. However, the match was suddenly scrapped soon after. Michaels would now defend the Intercontinental Championship in a ladder match against Razor Ramon, despite a lack of any onscreen buildup. On the August 7 Raw, Michaels attempted to attack Lawler, but was restrained by officials. Michaels wrestled Lawler on the August 14 Raw. Sid attempted to interfere in the match with a clothesline, but Michaels ducked and hit Sid with a superkick. Sid and Lawler regained the upper hand, and Sid chokeslammed Michaels. Razor Ramon ran in and assisted Michaels in clearing the ring of his attackers. Michaels and Razor then had a staredown, which led to a brawl. Razor came out on top. Despite being removed from SummerSlam, Sid was granted a future title shot, against whoever would be champion on the September 11 episode of Raw. Bret Hart had been feuding with Jerry Lawler for two years when they met at King of the Ring. Hart won the match and, per the stipulation, Lawler was forced to kiss Hart's feet, despite Hakushi's attempt to stop it. The following night on Raw, a vignette aired, showing Lawler visiting his dentist, Isaac Yankem, D.D.S., to have his teeth cleansed of foot smell. Yankem revealed to Lawler he used to be a professional wrestler. This began a storyline of Lawler attempting to avenge his loss to Hart. Over the following weeks, more vignettes from Yankem's office aired. They showed him treating his patients, while Lawler asked them which wrestlers they liked and disliked. On the July 24 Raw, Hart beat Hakushi. After the bout, Hart assaulted and piledrove Hakushi's manager, Shinja. Yankem and Hart did not have any direct interaction before their SummerSlam match. The WWF Women's Championship feud started on the April 3 episode of Raw. Moments after winning the title from Bull Nakano, Alundra Blayze was attacked by an unknown woman (later introduced as Bertha Faye). The attack sidelined Blayze with a broken nose. Faye, managed by Harvey Whippleman, had her debut match on the April 24 Raw, squashing La Pantera Serena. Blayze made her Raw return on May 29, stating she was cleared to wrestle in an interview with Vince McMahon. Faye and Whippleman responded with their own interview on the June 3 Superstars of Wrestling. Their SummerSlam match was announced on the August 7 episode of Raw. Event The first match to air was between Hakushi and The 1-2-3 Kid. Hakushi got the early advantage after hitting a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker. Both wrestlers performed multiple high spots. Late on, The Kid avoided a Diving headbutt, and followed with a series of offensive moves. The Kid attempted to perform his finisher, a spinning crescent kick, but Hakushi countered it into the Nenbutsu Bomb and pinned him. Hunter Hearst Helmsley faced Bob Holly in the second match. This was Helmsley's WWF pay-per-view wrestling debut. Toward the end of the bout, Holly gained the upper hand with a series of dropkicks. He attempted to toss Helmsley into the corner, but Helmsley reversed it, then hit his Pedigree finisher and made the pin . A tag team match was next. The Smoking Gunns (Bart Gunn and Billy Gunn) faced The Blu Brothers (Jacob Blu and Eli Blu), with their manager Uncle Zebekiah at ringside. The Blu Brothers held the advantage for the majority of the match, making quick tags to work over Billy. Billy eventually made the hot tag to Bart, who gained the immediate advantage but was booted in the face by Jacob. Bart regained the advantage, pushing Jacob into Eli. The Gunns followed up with their Sidewinder finisher for the pin. The next match was between Barry Horowitz and Skip of the Bodydonnas (managed by Sunny). Horowitz had defeated Skip in several matches shortly before SummerSlam. This match was both competitor and Sunny's first appearances on a WWF pay-per-view. Horowitz took control early and kept it for much of the match. Multiple illegal interferences from Sunny momentarily gave Skip the upper hand. Eventually, Hakushi came to ringside. He distracted Skip long enough for Horowitz to score a roll up pinfall and win the match. The following matchup was for the Women's Championship. Bertha Faye (managed by Harvey Whippleman) challenged Alundra Blayze. Momentum went back and forth several times. Eventually Faye was able to powerbomb Blayze and pin her, winning the Women's Championship. Next was the casket match between Kama (with manager Ted DiBiase) and The Undertaker (with manager Paul Bearer). The Undertaker took the early lead. Kama fought his way out of the casket several times and reversed the momentum with a leaping fist from the top rope. Kama then spent most of the match on the offensive. At one point, the Undertaker clotheslined Kama and both men went over the top rope into the casket and the lid shut but the match continued until a winner was decided. The Undertaker eventually ducked a clotheseline and choke slammed, then Tombstone Pile-driver, and then rolled Kama into the casket, closed the lid, and was declared the winner. The next match was between Isaac Yankem and Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart. This was Yankem's (later Kane's) debut and first WWF pay-per-view appearance. Yankem used several power moves to gain an early advantage against Hart. A missed charge to the turnbuckle flipped the momentum into Hart's favor. Yankem was eventually able to catch Hart midair and slam him down upon the top rope. After some time Yankem fell out of the ring. Hart took a running dive on top of him and then slammed his head into the steps. Hart applied the sharpshooter but Yankem was able to grab the ropes to break the hold. Jerry Lawler left his broadcast position to distract Hart, permitting Yankem to get the upper hand and slammed Hart into the stairs. However, Hart was able to throw Yankem from the top rope as he attempted a high risk maneuver. Additional interference from Lawler eventually led to a disqualification for Yankem. However Hart ended with his head twisted in the ropes and Lawler and Yankem pulling on his feet to choke him. The penultimate match of the night was a ladder match between Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels for the Intercontinental Championship. This was a rematch from their highly rated ladder match at WrestleMania 10. By this point in time Michaels had become a fan favorite, and so this was a rare matchup between two face superstars. In the midst of some back and forth both contenders went for their finishing moves but both times they were avoided. Razor was able to go out and retrieve the ladder but while trying to climb it Michaels was able to kick him off. The match went back and forth with both wrestlers climbing the ladder but being knocked off. Ramon began a strategy of attacking and injuring Michaels' left leg, twisting it in the ladder and dropping his boot and the ladder on it many times. Michaels eventually took the advantage with a suplex off the ladder and then several aerial attacks from the ladder. However when Michaels went for a splash from the very top of the ladder Ramon moved out of the way. Eventually Ramon was able to grab Michaels as he was climbing the ladder and convert it into a Razor's Edge. Razor was unable to capitalize, and when he went for a second Razor's Edge Michaels was able to backtoss him out of the ring. Michaels was then able to climb the ladder and take down the belt, winning the match. Ramon came back in, presented Michaels with the belt, and shook his hand. The final match was between King Mabel and Big Daddy Cool Diesel for the World Championship Belt. Mabel took the advantage early. At one point Mabel sit-splashed onto Diesel's back, injuring him in reality. Eventually the referee was knocked down. Sir Mo and Mabel then double teamed Diesel. Lex Luger came out from the backstage to help but ended up getting hit by Diesel in the fray and knocked back out. Eventually Luger was able to remove Mo from the match. Diesel was able to win with a rare aerial attack of a clotheseline off the second rope. Aftermath The night after SummerSlam was New Fall Season that aired on August 28, 1995 (taped on September 7, 1995) with \"Raw on Roof\" from Titan Towers following Superstars on September 9 then Raw on September 11 Lex Luger made his second to last appearance on WWF television in the main event (preventing Sir Mo from further interfering and that lead to a six man tag match with Sir Mo, Mabel and Sid in losing fashion to Lex, Shawn Michaels & The Undertaker that aired on New Fall Season on September 11, 1995 as a dark match before the show, and marked the end of The Allied Powers, making this Lex's final appearance. He rejoined World Championship Wrestling the next week. Diesel defended the WWF Championship against Owen Hart, Yokozuna, and Davey Boy Smith, before losing it to Bret Hart at Survivor Series. The Undertaker's feud with the Million Dollar Corporation ended, and he began to feud with King Mabel. Bret Hart continued to feud with Jerry Lawler and Isaac Yankem until the October 16, 1995 episode of Monday Night Raw, where Hart defeated Yankem in a steel cage match.

{"text": "The 1996 SummerSlam was the ninth annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 18, 1996, at the Gund Arena (now call Rocket Mortgage field house) in Cleveland, Ohio in the United States. Nine matches were contested at the event, including one match on the Free for All pre-show. Background SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, the Royal Rumble and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1996 event was the ninth event in the SummerSlam chronology and was scheduled to be held on August 18, 1996, at the Gund Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. Faarooq Asad had been scheduled to face Ahmed Johnson in a match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship at the event, but the match did not take place as Johnson was legitimately injured. Event The opening bout, which aired on the \"Free for All\" portion of the broadcast, was a singles match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Yokozuna. The match ended when the top rope broke as Yokozuna attempted a Banzai Drop (seated senton), enabling Austin to pin him for an upset victory. Todd Pettengill hosted the \"Bikini Beach Blast-Off\" party during the Free for All, where a pool was set up for everyone. Guests included Sunny, Sable, Marc Mero, The Smoking Gunns, Marlena, Goldust, T.L. Hopper, Who, Jerry Lawler, The Bushwhackers, Aldo Montoya, Hunter Hearst Helmsley, and Shawn Michaels. The second bout, and the first bout to air on the pay-per-view proper, was a singles match between Owen Hart and Savio Vega. During the match, Hart wore an orthopedic cast on his left arm. The match ended when Hart hit Vega with his cast then applied the Sharpshooter, defeating Vega by submission. Following the match, Justin Hawk Bradshaw attacked Vega. The third bout saw WWF Tag Team Champions The Smoking Gunns defend their titles against The Bodydonnas, The Godwinns, and The New Rockers in a four-way elimination match. The Bodydonnas were the first team eliminated after Marty Jannetty tripped Zip, enabling Billy Gunn to pin him. The New Rockers were the next team eliminated when Henry O. Godwinn pinned Leif Cassidy following a Slop Drop (reverse DDT). The Smoking Gunns went on to win the match and retain their titles when Bart Gunn gave Phineas I. Godwinn a diving double axe handle, enabling Billy Gunn to pin him. Following the match, The Smoking Gunn's manager Sunny unveiled a large picture of herself. The fourth bout was a singles match between The British Bulldog and Sycho Sid. Sid won the bout by pinning British Bulldog following a chokeslam and powerbomb. The fifth bout was a singles match between Goldust and Marc Mero. Goldust won the bout by pinfall following a Curtain Call (lifting inverted DDT). The sixth bout was a singles match between Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts and Jerry \"The King\" Lawler. Lawler won the bout by pinfall after hitting Roberts with a bottle of Jim Beam whiskey. Following the match, Lawler poured whisky onto Roberts until being stopped by Mark Henry. The penultimate bout was the first ever Boiler Room Brawl, Mankind’s specialty match. The heel Mankind would be facing The Undertaker, whom Mankind had been harassing and assaulting at random for months. Mankind would often hang out in the darkness of an arena’s boiler room (also known as a mechanical room), which was often hot and dusty, and where most of the arena’s internal infrastructure was. This match first featured The Undertaker entering the Gund Arena’s boiler room to seek out his arch-enemy, but Mankind struck first and they then proceeded to brawl for 30 minutes in the boiler room, the arena’s corridors, the entrance ramp and finally the ring, where Paul Bearer was waiting for one of the wrestlers to take his urn, which was the winning objective of the match. Bearer turned on his long-time protege, The Undertaker, to align himself with Mankind. The main event saw Shawn Michaels defend the WWF Championship against Vader. Vader originally won the match twice, first by countout (after he press-slammed Michaels onto the guard rail) and then by disqualification (when Michaels struck Vader repeatedly with Cornette's tennis racket), but because WWF championships can only change hands by pinfall or submission, Cornette demanded that the match restart both times. WWF President Gorilla Monsoon allowed this when Michaels agreed. Michaels went on to pin Vader after hitting him with a moonsault, thus retaining his title. Aftermath The main event feud between Shawn Michaels and Vader was supposed to continue until that year's Survivor Series event with Vader capturing the WWF Championship from the champion Michaels. However, due to several botches on the part of Vader during the match, Michaels voiced his frustrations about the match's execution to backstage where Vader was eventually stripped of his push. Michaels would eventually lose the title to Sycho Sid at Survivor Series.

{"text": "The 1997 SummerSlam (marketed as SummerSlam: Hart & Soul) was the 10th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 3, 1997, at the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Seven matches were contested at the event. This event was second to be held in New Jersey with the first previous event in 1989. The show also included the culmination of a contest in partnership with Discovery Zone with a $1 million prize which nobody actually won. It included several attempted calls where nobody was home. The contest ended after a potential winner failed to guess the proper key to the casket containing the prize money. The event also marked the first WWF pay-per-view appearance of Michael Cole, and the last WWF pay-per-view appearance of Todd Pettengill, who left the company before returning to host segments and matches of the WWE DVD and Blu-ray release The Best of In Your House: Pay-Per-View Classics 1995-1999 in 2013. Production Background SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1997 event was the 10th event in the SummerSlam chronology and was scheduled to be held on August 3, 1997, at the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Storylines SummerSlam 1997 featured professional wrestling matches involving different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines that were played out on Raw Is War and other World Wrestling Federation (WWF) television programs. Wrestlers portrayed a villain or a hero as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches. The featured rivalry heading into the event involved WWF Champion The Undertaker and Bret Hart. On the July 7 episode of Raw is War at Edmonton, Alberta, Hart was announced as the number one contender for the WWF Championship. In an interview with Vince McMahon, Hart said that if he did not win the title at SummerSlam, he would not wrestle on American soil again. The next week, Shawn Michaels, Hart's nemesis, requested Vince McMahon to be a part of SummerSlam. On the July 21 episode of Raw Is War, Hart, his brother Owen, and his brother-in-law The British Bulldog (The Hart Foundation), challenged three American wrestlers into a flag match. Michaels was announced as a special referee for the main event at SummerSlam, and in response to the announcement, Hart attacked Michaels and McMahon. Later, the Hart Foundation defeated the American team that contained the WWF Tag Team Champions Stone Cold Steve Austin and Dude Love, with the Undertaker, where the Hart Foundation won thanks to an interference from Brian Pillman. The next week, Hart challenged The Patriot, a match where Hart lost thanks to an interference from Michaels. After the match, the referees prevented Hart from attacking Michaels while the Undertaker watched from the entrance ramp. A predominant feud entering the event featured WWF Intercontinental Champion Owen Hart and Stone Cold Steve Austin. On July 6, on the Canadian Stampede pay-per-view, Hart managed to pin Austin in a five-on-five match. The day after it, Austin attacked Hart while he was singing the Canadian national anthem. At the same night, Austin told Vince McMahon that if he did not win the title from Hart at SummerSlam, he will kiss Hart's ass. The next week, Austin teamed up with Dude Love to win the vacant tag team titles in a match with Hart and the British Bulldog. On the July 21 episode of Raw Is War, Hart's team managed to defeat Austin's team at a three on three flag match. The next week, Hart attacked Austin during a WWF Tag Team Championship match against The Godwinns, counting him out. After the match, Austin attacked Hart. Another rivalry heading into event featured the WWF European Champion The British Bulldog and Ken Shamrock. The two were at opposing teams of the Canadian Stampede pay-per-view. On the July 14 episode of Raw Is War, the Bulldog said that if he lost at SummerSlam, he would eat a can of dog food right after the match. The next week, the Bulldog attacked Shamrock during a match with Vader, powerslamming him on the steel ramp, and making him lose the match via countout. The next week, Bulldog and Shamrock competed in an arm wrestling contest, but as Shamrock was about to win, the Bulldog headbutted him, hit him with a steel chair and poured a can of dog food over him. Steve Austin incident The event is perhaps best remembered for the WWF Intercontinental Championship match between Owen Hart and Stone Cold Steve Austin that featured Hart delivering a botched piledriver that legitimately injured Austin's neck and temporarily paralyzed him, leaving him with many years of neck issues and potentially derailing the WWF's momentum in the Monday Night Wars during a time when the WWF could ill afford to lose any more ground to World Championship Wrestling. In his audio book autobiography, Austin revealed that he and Hart were planning on the spots in the match when Austin (who was booked to win the match and the title) suggested to Hart about performing a piledriver as a false finish, under the condition that it was the knee-drop Tombstone piledriver variant used by The Undertaker as opposed to the more common variant of landing on his butt. Hart said he was more comfortable performing the latter variant but assured Austin that he would not hurt him. Coming off a critically-acclaimed feud with Hart's brother Bret Hart (who gained a reputation of not injuring opponents), Austin obliged. However, at the planned spot Hart wasn't able to protect Austin's head, leading to Austin to break his neck and temporarily suffer paralysis. (In an ironic bit of foreshadowing, Jim Ross mentioned several times on commentary about Austin's history of neck problems prior to the botched move.) Austin informed referee Earl Hebner that he could not move and that Hart should not touch him. Once Hebner informed Hart, he started buying time for Austin to recover by taunting the crowd that Austin was about to \"kiss his ass\" (per the pre-match stipulation if Austin did not win the title) until Austin had recovered enough to perform the \"worst roll-up ever\" to end the match early and with the scheduled finish of Austin winning the Intercontinental Championship. The injury left Austin sidelined for weeks, during a time when the WWF could ill-afford to have their biggest rising star off of television during their lowest point in the Monday Night Wars, when WCW was in the midst of an 83 week winning streak with WCW Monday Nitro beating out Raw is War. While Austin was able to recover, he continued to suffer neck issues and was written off television at the 1999 Survivor Series to undergo neck surgery, eventually forcing him to retire at age 38 in 2003. Austin has since stated that his neck is in good shape and he is in zero pain after his neck surgery was successful. The accident was a source of backstage conflict between the two men, but Austin ultimately forgave Hart, and paid tribute to him on Raw Is War the night after Hart fell to his death at Over the Edge 1999. However, Austin did admit that he does regret that he and Hart were not able to fully discuss the incident at hand before Hart's unexpected death. The botch, while initially appearing fatal for the WWF in the Monday Night Wars, ultimately proved to be a speed bump. However, the WWF still took preventative action, legitimately banning the piledriver in 2000. The Undertaker and Kane were grandfathered to keep using it, as the two were proven safe with the move (though Kane would eventually switch to the much safer chokeslam as his finishing move), while Rikishi began to use the Banzai drop (co-opted by his real-life cousin Yokozuna) as his finishing move. Subsequent wrestlers who used variations of the piledriver on the independent circuit such as Kevin Owens dropped the move from their moveset upon signing with the now-WWE. Reception In 2006, J.D. Dunn of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 5.0 [Not So Good], stating, \"It was headed into \"worst PPV ever\" territory until the final two matches. The WWF was trying hard to get things going during the summer of '97, but it would take another year before they started to win the war with WCW. Too much mediocre crap in the early matches is a big part of the reason why. Oddly enough, Austin's injury would turn him into more of a talker for the next few months, and he would get even *more* over with the fans. Plus, it led to the anti-authoritarian character that made all that money against Vince McMahon. Mild thumbs up for historical reasons and for Foley, Hart, Austin & Undertaker.\" The event contained several extended promo segments that did not appear to evoke much crowd reaction. For example, then-governor of New Jersey Christine Todd Whitman was given significant time on the microphone and a championship belt, for lowering taxes on professional wrestling events. In another segment, Todd Pettengill spent significant time calling several people on the phone with no one answering, as he stared at a list of names Tammy Lynn Sytch was holding under her cleavage, for a purported million-dollar sweepstakes promotion.

{"text": "The 1998 SummerSlam (marketed as SummerSlam: Highway to Hell) was the 11th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 30, 1998, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. Eleven matches were contested at the event, including three on the Sunday Night Heat pre-show. The main event was a Singles match for the WWF Championship between Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Undertaker. Austin won the match via pinfall after a Low Blow and Stunner to retain the WWF Championship. The main match on the undercard featured a ladder match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship between Triple H and The Rock, which Triple H went on to win the Intercontinental Championship. This SummerSlam was the notable for the pay-per-view in-ring debut of Edge. It was also notable for being the most-bought SummerSlam Pay-Per-View in the event's history, with 700,000 buys. Production Background SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1998 event was the 11th event in the SummerSlam chronology and was scheduled to be held on August 30, 1998, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. Storylines The main storyline heading into the event revolved around WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Undertaker. At King of the Ring, Austin had lost his championship in the inaugural First Blood match, however he won it back the next night on Raw is War. The pay-per-view match ended in controversy though; Kane's partner Mankind came to the ring, followed by Undertaker, whose attempted chair shot to Mankind was mistimed and instead met Austin, opening him up and costing him the match. Until this point, Undertaker had shown nothing but disdain for his younger brother since his debut the previous October but he explained on Raw that he would not sit idly by while his brother set himself on fire (the stipulation of the First Blood match should Kane lose.) On the July 6th episode of Raw is War, Vince McMahon announced a SummerSlam #1 Contender's match between Kane, Undertaker and Mankind. When Undertaker did not appear the match was started anyway with Kane savagely beating Mankind and winning much to the delight of McMahon, however mid celebration Kane ripped off his mask to reveal it was actually Undertaker in disguise. McMahon became obsessed with proving the brothers were conspiring against Austin and tried to prove this by putting champion and contender in a match for the WWF Tag Team Championship at Fully Loaded. McMahon could not bait Undertaker though as the team won the match but did not unify as a team for long, defending the titles until August 10, losing in a four corners tag match to Kane and Mankind. The next week, Austin arrived on Raw in a hearse and challenged Undertaker to a fight; at the end of the show Undertaker came to the ring and Austin followed, however when Undertaker fully faced Austin it became apparent it was actually Kane in his brother's attire, using his hair to hide his mask previously. Austin threw Kane in the back of the hearse but when he went to drive away, Undertaker appeared in the driver's seat and drove his brother away, thus revealing the alliance between the two, cemented by a beat down on Paul Bearer the following week, and greatly reducing the champions chances at SummerSlam. The second storyline heading into the event involved The Rock defending the WWF Intercontinental Championship against Triple H in a Ladder Match. Last month at Fully Loaded, Rock and Triple H fought for the Intercontinental Championship in a two out of three falls match which ended in a no contest. The two continued their rivalry while leading up their respective factions Nation of Domination and D-Generation X. On the August 17 episode of Raw is War, DX and the Nation fought in a street fight which the Nation won when Rock rammed a ladder in Triple H's face causing him to bleed from the mouth. Backstage after the match, Triple H challenged Rock to a Ladder match for the Intercontinental title at SummerSlam. On the August 23 episode of Sunday Night Heat, Rock accepted the challenge. Event D'Lo Brown defended his European Championship against Val Venis, initially showing respect to him when the two slapped hands. However, Brown would soon use his chest protector to gain leverage over Venis when the latter made an early advantage. Despite the protector, Venis still managed to retain some offensive momentum, legsweeping Brown out of the turnbuckle leading the champion to escape outside the ring. The two then embarked on a number of Irish whip maneuvers with frequent reversals, Venis perhaps taking Brown down more often. Despite flooring Venis with an Irish whip to the turnbuckle, Brown lost any advantage by gesturing to the crowd, though Venis' comeback was short-lived. Brown kept Venis mostly low, making many ground attacks from a standing position and the top ropes, often trying pins in between then switching tactics by applying a Texas cloverleaf. Rather than keep the pressure though, Brown let go and missed a senton bomb from the second rope, allowing Venis to recover and fight back with knees to the chest and elbow attacks. Venis tried to capitalize on this with his finisher, the money shot, but as Brown began to stand up Venis opted for a dropkick instead, however he was met with the grip of Brown who turned it into a Sky High instead but still Venis would not be pinned, similarly even after a DDT. Brown tried a high flying move of his own but Venis caught him mid air for a scoop slam. Despite subduing Brown with a double-armed suplex and a slam, Brown managed to get his knees up and after this attempted a powerbomb. The first powerbomb was unsuccessful though, Brown unable to flip Venis onto his shoulders and subsequently dropping him onto his head; the second though was a successful running powerbomb but rather than pin him, Brown attempted, and missed, the Lo Down. Venis then pulled off Brown's chest protector, putting it on himself and causing the referee to try to pull it off him. As Venis climbed the turnbuckle the referee accidentally pulled the ropes, causing Venis to land on his crotch. He still managed a Manhattan drop on Brown though, trying to climb the turnbuckle again with the referee still pulling at the chest protector. This time Venis shoved the referee to the ground, causing him to lose the match via disqualification; after the match he slammed the referee and landed the Moneyshot. The Oddities, welcomed to the ring by Insane Clown Posse singing their music, lived up to their title when Golga, having had his head smashed against the turnbuckle by Taka Michinoku, headbanged voluntarily. After pouring water into Yamaguchi-San's shoe, the match began in earnest with Funaki being thrown around the ring by Kurrgan and despite the entire team illegally attacking Kurrgan, holding his arms, he still managed to kick away Funaki and toss the others restraining his hand. When Giant Silva was tagged in, all of Kaientai fled the ring, regrouping outside before Dick Togo was sent into the ring but similar to before the entire team soon ganged up on him but Silva piled all four of them into the turnbuckle, crushing them back into the padding before Irish whipping them into the opposite corner and then tossing Taka over the top rope, falling onto the other three members. Golga was the first Oddity brought to the floor, with a double slam by Funaki and Mens Teioh which was followed up by four big splashes by all members. Kai En Tai followed suite with four running elbow drops but a four-man Irish whip was met with a clothesline that took all of them out. With Kurrgan tagged in, the four tried to attack him but Kurrgan and Silva choked all four between the two of them. Yamaguchi tried to attack Kurrgan from behind but Luna Vachon scoop slammed him and all four of Kai En Tai received a chokeslam in unison and Golga covered all four of them to pick up the pin count. The Hair match saw Jeff Jarrett's accomplices, Southern Justice, sent to the back by Commissioner Slaughter whilst Howard Finkel accompanied X-Pac to the ring, performing the signature crotch chops. The match moved both in and out of the ring early on, with Jarrett rushing X-Pac's open legs onto the ring post, leaving him almost to be counted out. When he returned to the ring, Jarrett continued his dominance with basic punching and Irish whips to the turnbuckle. X-Pac returned with a desperate swinging DDT allowing him to take some time to recover, but his attacking maneuvers were met with a sleeper hold. An attempt to put Jarrett in the sleeper hold saw him lifted from behind onto the turnbuckle but X-Pac used this to his advantage, spinning round into a crossbody which missed contact with his opponent. With both men on the floor, Jarrett applied his figure four leg lock in the middle of the ring, which X-Pac struggled to counter by turning over, eventually making it to the rope after a minute or so. Jarrett tried to lock the submission again but X-Pac kicked him from behind into the corner, catching him with a backdrop as Jarrett stumbled out. Despite a spinning heel kick and bronco buster, Jarrett was still able to land a diving crossbody, though X-Pac rolled it in his favor. Finkel climbed onto the apron to complain of a low blow attempt, when Jarrett turned back to the ring X-Pac landed an X Factor. Southern Justice appeared from the back, but X-Pac ducked El Kabong from Dennis Knight, grabbing the guitar and hitting Jarrett with it while the referee pushed Southern Justice out of the ring. Once the pinfall was made, fellow Degenerates, New Age Outlaws rushed to ringside with chairs to chase away Southern Justice while The Headbangers and Darren Drozdov helped hold Jarrett in his chair while he had his hair removed, though he escaped the ring before he was completely shaved bald. Sable arrived to the ring and introduced her mystery tag team partner, with Edge coming through the crowd to make his pay-per-view debut. Marc Mero and Edge were the initial opponents though Mero soon tagged in Jacqueline, however she immediately tagged Mero back when confronted by Sable. On the outside Jacqueline pulled at Edge's feet while running, allowing Mero to take the advantage and, with the referee distracted, choked him on the bottom rope. Mero attempted a TKO but Edge swung round to secure a DDT and with both men down they crawled to tag in their prospective female partners. Sable instantly scooped Jacqueline and punched her before chasing her around the ring and back in. Inside the ring Mero tried to subdue Sable, but he was lowblowed and then he almost got a Sable Bomb, but Jacqueline saved Mero this allowed Jacqueline to take some advantage but Sable soon turned the tables back in her favor, landing a TKO on Jacqueline. Mero pulled Sable off the pin and while distracted, was double teamed by both opponents. Jacqueline accidentally hit her partner though, letting Sable tag in Edge who made a running suicide leap onto Mero, before whipping him into the steel steps and spanking Jacqueline on the walkway. A pinning attempt after a super neckbreaker was put on hold when Mero's partner put his feet on the bottom rope. Once again the two accidentally collided, when Edge ducked out of the way leaving Jacqueline on the outside of the ring. When Mero went to the top rope, Edge reversed leaving him sitting on the turnbuckle and then tagged in Sable who delivered a frankensteiner. Edge then went to pin Mero but leapt off him when he saw Jacqueline flying for a splash, leading the two to collide once again. Sable and Edge then whipped their respective opponents into the corner, with Mero falling out of it and then Jacqueline falling head first onto his crotch. Edge then grabbed Sable by her legs and planted her face first onto Mero to secure the pin. The Lion's Den match, which took place in a separate theatre within Madison Square Garden in front of a special crowd, was contested in a pseudo-circular polygon cage, with steel wire and no ropes approximately ten feet high. After both competitors entered the den, the door was chained shut. The match began with Owen Hart being driven into the steel wall and then slammed into the ground, though Ken Shamrock would receive the same treatment. Shamrock then backdropped Hart and picked up to hold him in submission around his head. Though Hart threw Shamrock into the wall, Shamrock instantly retaliated with a clothesline and proceeded to pull off Hart's shirt and use it to choke Hart from behind, bringing him down with a snapmare using the cloth and continuing to pull at his neck. As Hart stood up, Shamrock jumped into the cage and jumped back off it, higher, to crossbody his opponent. After throwing Hart into the wall again, Shamrock soon felt the wrath of the den as he was driven into the metal frames that secured the chain. Hart caught Shamrock's foot, but the latter followed through with an enzuigiri negating either advantage. As the two returned to their feet it became an exchange of punches before Shamrock again used the cage to aid him into a flying shoulder barge, but the second time he did this Hart caught him and slammed him into the mat and used the advantage to lock in the Sharpshooter. Shamrock slowly crawled to the cage and used his fingers to climb up, building pressure on his own legs but making it awkward for Hart to sustain the hold. Despite breaking out Hart managed to catch Shamrock, bending him backwards with his arm wrapped around Shamrock's neck. Shamrock broke free by walking up the steel and flipping over the back of Hart, tripping him with a toe hold that allowed him to utilize an arm bar submission before applying his ankle lock that forced Dan Severn to walk away in disgust and Hart to tap out. With Kane absent from the arena, the falls count anywhere match for the WWF Tag Team Championship became a de facto handicap match. New Age Outlaws brought out a dumpster full of weapons, alluding to an incident in February where they had locked Mankind, as Cactus Jack, and Chainsaw Charlie in a dumpster and thrown it off the stage. Billy Gunn ran into the ring and met with a baking tray to his head from Mankind before the two had a sword fight of sorts, with a steel chair. Despite Mankind taking the advantage from this, the tandem attacks of baking sheets to the head subdued Mankind until he was caught in the ropes. After taking more weapons to the head, Mankind managed to toss Gunn over his back to the outside and fought Road Dogg into the corner. When Mankind went back out the ring to continue his assault on Gunn, though, the handicap caught up with him and he was thrown against the dumpster. Road Dogg opened up a table in the corner but Mankind managed to reverse the Irish whip, forcing Gunn through it. After a double team elevated neckbreaker did not dispatch him, he suffered a double team powerbomb through two chairs and again this did not keep Mankind down (although after Mankind kicked out, the Outlaws music briefly played) but finally a spiked piledriver onto the championship belt was enough to keep him down. After winning, Outlaws put Mankind in the dumpster and closed the lid. Whilst the Outlaws celebrated, the lid of the dumpster opened and Kane stood up, picking up a sledgehammer and throwing it down on an unseen Mankind inside the dumpster. Triple H entered the ring behind the DX Band, performing Break It Down live, finishing with Chris Warren on Triple H's shoulders and the band throwing the drums apart. The WWF Intercontinental Championship Ladder match began with Triple H clotheslining The Rock to the floor and striking him on the ground before a facebuster onto his knee and crotch chopping Rock. An early Rock Bottom was blocked with a strike, while Rock reversed the Pedigree by standing up and forcing Triple H over the top rope onto the mat. Rock's attempt to bring the ladder into the match saw him attacked from behind by Triple H and thrown from crowd barrier into crowd barrier. Inside the ring, Rock was allowed some time and used it to recover and take the fight to Triple H, throwing him through the ladder back outside the ring. As Rock secured the ladder inside the ring and began to climb it, Triple H slowly made his way back to ringside, climbing from the apron to the turnbuckle and jumping into Rock's back, forcing his head into the ladder and causing him to fall off however as the momentum shook Triple H to the side, the ladder fell on top of him. After Triple H drove the ladder into Rock's chest he began to climb it but four steps up, Rock pulled away at his leg, causing him to land on his previously injured knee. After continuing to work on Triple H's knee, Rock pushed the ladder onto his leg and then used it as a vice, trapping his knee in it and kicking the ladder on it, then using a chair similar to a hammer, reinforcing the ladder onto the knee. Rock then set up the ladder horizontally between the steps and the crowd barrier, picking his opponent up for a modified atomic drop, but with the knee taking the brunt of the drop onto the ladder. However, as The Rock took his time to take the ladder into the ring and set it up before climbing it, Triple H was able to desperately push his opponent off it and throw him out of the ring. The advantage did not remain though, as his own plans were used against him when Rock threw Triple H by his legs into the closed ladder, then falling face first onto the Spanish announce table. As Triple H crawled around, the fight moved to the walkway where both opponents threw each other into the barriers before Triple H tried to perform a Pedigree onto the ladder, but was tossed over his back onto it instead. Back inside the ring, Mark Henry threw a second ladder to Rock which he began to climb while Henry tried to subdue Triple H on the outside but was met with a forearm by Chyna. Triple H arrived just in time to push Rock off the ladder, crashing onto the mat and outside the ring. Triple H received similar treatment after recovering, then climbing the ladder only to have the ladder fall away from beneath him. After a DDT that left both men floored, both men eventually stood back up and then climbed either side of the same ladder, punching each other at the top with Triple H being thrown into the ladder in the turnbuckle and rebound to knock Rock off the ladder onto the ropes. Chyna had Triple H a chair which he hit Rock with, albeit with a ladder in the middle and continued a barrage of chair shots onto Rock through the ladder. This would not keep Rock down though, as he soon scooped Triple H onto the ladder and performed the People's Elbow with Triple H lying on the ladder. Despite receiving a Rock Bottom, Triple H managed to stagger to his feet just in time to pull Rock off the top rung of the ladder by his trunks and flooring him with a Pedigree. Struggling back to his feet anyway, Henry threw flour into Triple H's eyes but he slowly managed to climb by feel alone; although Rock was able to climb up to the top and meet him, Chyna used her forearm to low blow Rock, buying Triple H enough time to take the belt from where it was hanging. The WWF Championship match began with each wrestler punching the other into the corner. After some grappling, a flurry of reversed arm twists refused to give either wrestler a noticeable advantage with Austin eventually dragging The Undertaker to the ground with an arm bar. Eventually Undertaker stood up and the two fought back and forth again, with Austin attempting a Lou Thesz press but being caught in a bear hug before having his neck thrown on the ropes. After this he began to attack Austin's back, first in the turnbuckle and then trying to trap him on the apron, but Stone Cold soon caught his opponent's leg and bashed it into the ring post. Austin returned to the knee, stomping it, after yanking Undertaker off the top rope from an Old School. It was at this point Kane made his presence known, walking solemnly to the ring but The Undertaker composed himself and sent him to the back. Again Austin attacked Undertaker's knee, using the leverage of the ring apron until an enraged Undertaker grabbed Austin by the neck, picking him up from the outside to the apron and then carrying him over the top rope and running, plunging him into the mat for a running chokeslam. The fight was then taken to the outside of the ring, going up the walk way and through the crowd with Austin being thrown over the crowd barrier and back into the ring. Austin, however, attempted a stunner and Undertaker responded by walking backwards, flipping over the top rope to the outside. When Stone Cold tried to attack him, he was caught in mid air and rammed into the ringpost. He was then smacked into the exposed Spanish announce table and left lying there was Undertaker went back into the ring and climbed the turnbuckle to deliver a flying guillotine leg drop that did connect, but did not break the table. When both competitors made it back to the ring, Austin kicked out of the pin count and when both resumed fighting the match was at a stalemate, with an exchange of attacks leading to a double clothesline, flooring both competitors. When the two made it up from that, though, Austin took a definite advantage, ramming his shoulder into Undertaker's chest before striking both a Lou Thesz press and an elbow drop. A botched stunner, turned neckbreaker, saw Undertaker kick out at two and in the ensuing fight, chokeslam the champion once more, signaling for his finisher. However, Stone Cold slipped off Undertaker's back when he tried this, but couldn't manage a stunner himself, the challenger picking him up by the leg and leaving him stranded on the ropes before pulling him to the ground with a Russian leg sweep, causing him to bleed from his mouth. When Undertaker tried an Old School again, it seemed successful until he jumped off the ropes and met with a low blow which caused him to stumble and fall into a Stone Cold Stunner, losing the match via pinfall. The Undertaker almost instantly sat up, having grabbed the championship belt from the referee and stood opposite Austin. Rather than strike him though, he gave the belt to the champion and nodded in respect, retiring to the walkway where he was met shoulder to shoulder with Kane, both looking on as Austin celebrated. Reception The event has received positive reviews from critics. In 2017, Kevin Pantoja of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 7.0 [Good], stating, \"I’d call this one of the better SummerSlam events in history. The only thing that I found truly bad was the overly long Oddities tag. The other two tag matches were both lackluster but not terrible. The rest of the show rules though. You have arguably the best Taker/Austin match, a surprisingly good opener, the cool Lion’s Den match, a good Hair vs. Hair match and of course, the standout Ladder match that helped make two of the biggest stars in company history.\" In 2018, Chris of Retro Pro Wrestling gave the event a rating of Outstanding, stating, \"By far one of the better Summerslams in the event's history up to that point, there wasn't a single bad match on the card tonight. OK, so the Oddities/Kai En Tai comedy spot wasn't to everyone's liking, but it was harmless fun and this fan enjoyed it just fine. Elsewhere, we got good matches from D'Lo/Val, X-Pac/Jarrett and Austin/Taker, whilst Triple H and The Rock stole the show long before stealing the show became the prerogative of modern performers. Overall, an outstanding show that is definitely worth watching.\" In 2022, John Canton of TJRWrestling gave the event a rating of 8/10, stating, \"Good matches all night long plus the breakout ladder match by Hunter and Rock make this one of the better SummerSlams ever. Fun to watch when it happened and still brings a smile to my face nearly 20 years later.\" Aftermath Austin and the Undertaker continued to feud following SummerSlam, and eventually it was revealed that both Undertaker and Kane were in cahoots with Vince McMahon to try to rid Austin of the title. This led to a match at Breakdown: In Your House in September between Austin and the brothers, where Undertaker and Kane were not allowed to pin each other. The match ended with both Undertaker and Kane pinning Austin simultaneously, which cost Austin the WWF Championship but left the title vacant. Austin was then forced to be the special guest referee for a match between Undertaker and Kane for the vacant title at Judgment Day: In Your House in October, where he was threatened with being fired if he did not count the fall. Late in the match, after Undertaker hit Kane with a chair handed to him by his brother's manager Paul Bearer, Austin attacked Undertaker and counted both men pinned, declaring himself the champion. McMahon made good on his threat to fire Austin immediately thereafter, and the title remained vacant until Survivor Series. The night after Judgment Day Undertaker reunited with Paul Bearer and began recruiting for his Ministry of Darkness. After defeating Owen Hart, Ken Shamrock's longstanding feud that dated back to when Hart had joined the Nation of Domination came to an end. After briefly joining forces with The Rock and Mankind, Shamrock turned on Mankind and became a heel. The turn coincided with a legitimate injury suffered by Triple H, who was stripped of the Intercontinental Championship shortly after SummerSlam due to an injury. Shamrock won an eight-man tournament for the Intercontinental Championship in October and held it for the remainder of the year. Before the end of the year, Shamrock also joined The Corporation. D-Generation X continued to feud with Jeff Jarrett and Southern Justice for one additional pay-per-view, with the New Age Outlaws and X-Pac defeating Jarrett and his valets at Breakdown. X-Pac began feuding with D-Lo Brown after Breakdown and won the European Championship twice, while Road Dogg and Billy Gunn reigned as tag team champions until they were defeated by The Corporation's Ken Shamrock and The Big Boss Man in December 1998. As for Jarrett and Hart, they eventually began teaming together following Summerslam. Although Hart largely began wrestling as \"The Blue Blazer\" shortly after the team was founded, the two enjoyed some success as a team and eventually became tag team champions in January 1999. After defeating The Rock in the ladder match to become Intercontinental Champion for the second time, Triple H had suffered a knee injury and he took time off to have surgery. On October 9, Vince McMahon stripped Triple H of the championship and set up a tournament for the vacated title which saw Ken Shamrock defeat X-Pac in the finals to become the new champion. Triple H would return in November 1998 and reunite with X-Pac saving him from a beating at the hands of Shamrock and Big Bossman. He would continue to feud with Rock who was part of The Corporation challenging him twice for the WWF Championship. At the end of the year he would challenge Shamrock for the Intercontinental title. He won the match by disqualification when Shamrock refused to release his Ankle lock submission hold. After the match, Billy Gunn saved Triple H which lead to a feud between him and Shamrock. The feud between DX and The Corporation continued until March 1999. Although he was still considered to be a heel going into Summerslam, The Rock became a face shortly thereafter due to an increasingly positive crowd reaction. It was during this time that he began aggressively promoting himself as \"The People's Champion\", which eventually led him into a feud with McMahon entering Survivor Series and the two eventually becoming allies. After over two years of portraying a tortured soul character, Mankind began a transition towards a more comedic character. After his brief feud with Shamrock, which included an Intercontinental Championship match at Judgment Day that Mankind lost, he began aligning himself with Vince McMahon in an attempt to become his friend. This led to Mankind becoming McMahon's protege, and led to Mankind apparently being given an easy road to win the vacant WWF title. The end of this angle coincided with the end of McMahon's feud with The Rock, and after Survivor Series Mankind and The Rock began a feud that led until the following February. After helping Sable defeat Marc Mero and Jacqueline, Edge entered a feud with Gangrel that eventually included Christian Cage, who was introduced as his storyline brother. After feuding for several weeks Edge was eventually convinced to join with Gangrel and Christian and the three formed a stable known as The Brood. Sable and Jacqueline then began feuding over the reactivated WWF Women's Championship, which Jacqueline won in September and Sable defeated her for in November at Survivor Series. Marc Mero quietly disappeared from the WWF shortly after going on a losing streak.

{"text": "The 1999 SummerSlam was the 12th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 22, 1999, at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Nine matches were contested at the event. Production Background SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1999 event was the 12th SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 22, 1999, at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Storylines The main feud heading into SummerSlam was between Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H and Mankind over the WWF Championship. The previous month at Fully Loaded, Austin retained the WWF Championship by defeating The Undertaker in a first blood match when X-Pac interfered, allowing Austin to hit Undertaker with a television camera. Also at Fully Loaded, Triple H defeated The Rock in a Strap match to become the number one contender for the WWF Championship, thanks to the help of Billy Gunn and Chyna. In recent weeks, Triple H stated that he's been studying Austin for months to figure out how to beat him. On the August 9th episode of Raw is War, it was revealed that Minnesota governor as well as fellow WWF legend Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura would be the special guest referee for the main event at SummerSlam. When Triple H came out and got in Ventura's face, WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels set up a match between Austin, Triple H and Undertaker. When Austin was found mysteriously attacked in a stairwell, Michaels accused Triple H of being the attacker but Triple H denied it. Michaels then set up a Triple threat match with the title of number one contender on the line between Triple H, Undertaker and Chyna. Austin returned later that night and hit Triple H with a chair, then put Chyna on top allowing her to win the match and become number one contender. The following week, Triple H challenged Chyna to a match with her number one contender status on the line which Chyna accepted. Chyna again won the match after Mankind returned from a knee injury and attacked Triple H. Mankind then challenged Chyna for her number one contender status but Chyna refused to accept and low blowed Mankind, Michaels overruled Chyna and made the match. Mankind later defeated Chyna when Triple H attempted to interfere. Shane McMahon stated as owner of the WWF he was booking a match between Mankind and Triple H to determine the undisputed number one contender. Michaels agreed to the match and he and Shane named themselves as referees. When Mankind and Triple H covered each other, Michaels and Shane both counted to three but they argued over who is the number one contender. Ring announcer Tony Chimel announced that both men are winners and that there will be a Triple threat match at SummerSlam. Another rivalry heading into SummerSlam was between Test and Shane McMahon. In July before Fully Loaded, Shane and the Mean Street Posse had started a feud with Test because of his relationship with Stephanie McMahon whom Shane feels was dating \"beneath the family standards\". Over the following weeks, Test had faced Posse member Joey Abs whom Shane had set up on a date with Stephanie. On the July 12 episode of Raw is War, Test wrestled the Posse in a Gauntlet match but it ended in no contest when Shane interfered. When the Posse attempted to break Test's ankle, Stephanie came out and grabbed her brother from behind. Thinking that it was a referee, Shane backhand elbowed his sister and knocked her out. The following two weeks, Stephanie rejected Joey Abs and demanded that her brother and his friends stay out of her life. On the August 15 episode of Sunday Night Heat, Shane challenged Test to a \"Love her or Leave her\" Greenwich Street Fight at SummerSlam. If Shane won Test and Stephanie could no longer see each other but if Test won Shane would give his blessing to them. Test agreed and accepted the challenge. The third rivalry heading into SummerSlam was between the teams of X-Pac and Kane against The Undertaker and Big Show for the WWF Tag Team Championship. After X-Pac interfered in Undertaker's first blood match with Stone Cold Steve Austin at Fully Loaded, Undertaker blamed X-Pac for costing him the WWF Championship and attacked him the next night on Raw is War. Kane came to his partner's rescue and brawled with his brother until Big Show (whom Kane lost to at Fully Loaded) ran out to the ring and joined Undertaker in putting a beating on both of them. Then Undertaker and Big Show shook hands and formed an alliance. Two weeks later, Kane and X-Pac defeated the Acolytes to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. Road Dogg came out to celebrate with them however all three were attacked by Big Show and Undertaker leading to a Tag Team Championship match between the two teams at SummerSlam. The fourth rivalry heading into SummerSlam was between The Rock and Billy Gunn. At Fully Loaded, Rock lost to Triple H in a strap match after Gunn along with Chyna interfered and prevented Rock from pinning Triple H thus costing Rock the number one contender status for the WWF Championship. The next night on Raw is War, Chyna dared The Rock to come out and repeat what he had said about her backstage to her face. When Rock came out, Gunn attacked Rock from behind with a club and he and Chyna double teamed him in the ring. Rock got up from the assault and challenged them both to a handicap match which he later won when he pinned Gunn after the people's elbow. The following week, it was announced that Rock and Gunn would face off in a match at SummerSlam. Reception In 2014, Dylan Diot of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 7.5 [Good], stating, \"This is one of the more underrated editions of SummerSlam. [I] was pleasantly surprised by just how much I enjoyed the show. The wrestling was consistent with plenty of good performances across the board. That Shane McMahon/Test match is sensational and it should have helped launch Test as a major star and it showed that Shane McMahon is actually a capable in ring performer. They kept the overbooking, swerves, and nonsensical booking to a minimum and it resulted in exciting matches and a great atmosphere. Go out of your way to check this out, it really is an underrated gem of a show.\" The event was rated as the third best pay-per-view of 1999 by YouTube wrestling channel Cultaholic Wrestling in their ranking of every 1999 PPV ranked from worst to best. Results Tag team turmoil Aftermath After Triple H attacked Stone Cold after the match with steel chair shots to his legs and knee, Austin took time off to rehab from the injury but vowed to get revenge on Triple H. The next night on Raw is War, Triple H bragged about crippling Austin and challenged Mankind to a match for the WWF Championship. With Shane McMahon as guest referee, Triple H defeated Mankind after a pedigree to win his first WWF Championship. Mankind later formed an alliance with The Rock and they became known as The Rock 'n' Sock Connection. On the August 30 episode of Raw is War, they defeated Undertaker and Big Show to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. On the September 9 episode of SmackDown!, they lost the titles back to Undertaker and Big Show in a buried alive tag team match after Triple H interfered and hit Big Show with a slegehammer before he helped to bury Mankind. Austin returned and got revenge on Triple H by attacking him and throwing him into an ambulance before ramming it with a 18 wheeler truck. On the September 13 episode of Raw is War, Triple H had Austin arrested for aggravated assault and demanded that Linda McMahon put Austin at the bottom level of the ladder. Linda refused and Triple H began to accost her until Vince McMahon came to his wife's aid. Vince stated that he wouldn't get involved in WWF business but it was personal between him and Triple H. As he challenged him, Austin returned and attacked Triple H but lost a WWF title match to him when he punched referee Earl Hebner getting disqualified in the process. Three days later on SmackDown!, Triple H had been ordered into a title defense of the WWF Championship. He picked Shane as the referee and picked Vince McMahon as his opponent. Vince won the match and the title when Austin attacked Triple H with a stunner. On the September 20 episode of Raw is War, Vince vacated the WWF Championship as he was prohibited from taking part in the company's day to day business due to the Fully Loaded contract he signed. Austin stated that he would reinstate him back in the WWF if he grants him his title shot. Vince accepted and stated that Austin would meet the winner of the six pack challenge match for the vacant WWF Championship at Unforgiven. He then announced that the vacant slot is given to Triple H and Austin would be the enforcer for the match. At Unforgiven, Triple H regained the WWF Championship after winning the six pack challenge match when pinned Rock after a pedigree and Austin made the count. Ken Shamrock would enter into a feud with the debuting Chris Jericho after Jericho launched numerous insults at him, then Jericho employed the returning Curtis Hughes as his bodyguard (similar to his gimmick in WCW when he had a bodyguard named \"Ralphus\"). The feud between Test and Shane McMahon continued as the next night on Raw is War, Test came to the ring to propose to Stephanie McMahon but before she would accept they were interrupted by Shane who said that their relationship would continue \"Over my dead body!\" Stephanie scolded her brother asking him why he would take away something away from her that made her so happy. She then told Test that she loved him but said she just needed sometime to think and walked away smiling. On the August 26 premiere episode of SmackDown!, Test again proposed to Stephanie and she finally accepted. As they celebrated their engagement with a kiss, Shane and the Mean Street Posse hit the ring and attacked Test until he was saved by Mankind. Later Test and Stephanie announced their wedding date would be on the October 11th episode of Raw is War. As they shared the news with the fans and with Pat Patterson, Gerald Brsico and Linda McMahon in the ring with them, The Posse who is now with Terri Runnels again interrupted and Shane came out and ended the feud by telling the Posse to leave and gave his blessing for Test and Stephanie's relationship asking Test to always treat Stephanie right. The Posse responded the following week on Raw is War, by rebelling against Shane orders and Joey Abs challenged Test to a match after calling Stephanie a tramp. Test won the match but when the Posse attacked him again, Shane saved his future brother in law and he and Test chased the Posse out of the arena. On the September 16 episode of SmackDown!, Shane challenged Abs to a match which he won after recieveing help from Patterson, Brisco and Shawn Stasiak who was the referee.

{"text": "Iron Man is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures, it is the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Jon Favreau from a screenplay by the writing teams of Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, the film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Leslie Bibb, and Shaun Toub. In the film, following his escape from captivity by a terrorist group, world-famous industrialist and master engineer Tony Stark builds a mechanized suit of armor and becomes the superhero Iron Man. A film featuring the character was in development at Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and New Line Cinema at various times since 1990, before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2005. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April 2006, and faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey in the title role; the actor was signed in September. Filming took place from March to June 2007, primarily in California to differentiate the film from numerous other superhero stories that are set in New York City-esque environments. During filming, the actors were free to create their own dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armor, created by Stan Winston's company, were mixed with computer-generated imagery to create the title character. Iron Man premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in the United States on May 2, being the first film in Phase One of the MCU. It grossed over $585 million, becoming the eighth-highest grossing film of 2008. The film received praise from critics, especially for Downey's performance, as well as Favreau's direction, visual effects, action sequences, and writing. It was selected by the American Film Institute as one of the ten best films of 2008 and received two nominations at the 81st Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. In 2022, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Two sequels have been released: Iron Man 2 (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013). Plot Tony Stark, who has inherited the defense contractor Stark Industries from his late father Howard Stark, is in war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison, Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, to demonstrate the new \"Jericho\" missile. After the demonstration, his convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by a missile used by the attackers—one of his company's own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings. Yinsen, a fellow captive and doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but he and Yinsen believe that Raza will not keep his word. Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a prototype suit of powered armor to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings discover their hostages' intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit powers up. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will cease manufacturing weapons. Obadiah Stane, his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for it and his chest. Personal assistant Pepper Potts places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, a suspicious Stark decides to keep his work to himself. At a charity event held by Stark Industries, reporter Christine Everhart informs Stark that his company's weapons were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is attacked by two F-22 Raptors. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who has been trafficking arms to the Ten Rings and has staged a coup to replace Stark as Stark Industries' CEO by hiring the Ten Rings to kill him. He subdues Raza and has him and the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new suit reverse-engineered from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Potts to hack into its database. She discovers that Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged when they realized they had a direct route to Stark's weapons. Potts meets with Agent Phil Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D., an intelligence agency, to inform him of Stane's activities. Stane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and steals the one from his chest. Stark manages to replace it with his original reactor. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, where Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to being the superhero the press has dubbed \"Iron Man\". In a post-credits scene, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury visits Stark at home, telling him that Iron Man is not \"the only superhero in the world\", and explaining that he wants to discuss the \"Avenger Initiative\". Cast Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man: An industrialist, genius inventor, and playboy, he is CEO of Stark Industries and chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military. Director Jon Favreau felt that Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part and that the actor could not only make Stark a \"likable asshole,\" but also portray an authentic emotional journey, once he had won over the audience. Favreau was also attracted to Downey because of his performance in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Downey frequently spoke with that film's director, Shane Black, about the script and dialogue in Iron Man. Downey had an office next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater involvement in the screenwriting process, especially when it came to adding humor to the film. Downey explained, \"What I usually hate about these [superhero] movies [is] when suddenly the guy that you were digging turns into Dudley Do-Right, and then you're supposed to buy into all his 'Let's go do some good!' That Eliot Ness-in-a-cape-type thing. What was really important to me was to not have him change so much that he's unrecognizable. When someone used to be a schmuck and they're not anymore, hopefully they still have a sense of humor.\" To get into shape, Downey spent five days a week weight training and practiced martial arts, which he said benefited him because \"it's hard not to have a personality meltdown ... after about several hours in that suit. I'm calling up every therapeutic moment I can think of to just get through the day.\" Terrence Howard as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes: A friend of Stark's and the liaison between Stark Industries and the United States Air Force in the department of acquisitions, specifically weapons development. Favreau cast Howard because he felt he could play War Machine in a sequel. Howard prepared for the role by visiting Nellis Air Force Base on March 16, 2007, where he ate with the pilots and observed HH-60 Pave Hawk rescue helicopters and F-22 Raptors. While Rhodes is roguish in the comics after he meets Stark, his previous role as a disciplinarian creates a dynamic tension with Stark's character. He is unsure whether Stark's actions are acceptable. \"Rhodey is completely disgusted with the way Tony has lived his life, but at a certain point he realizes that perhaps there is a different way,\" Howard said. \"Whose life is the right way: Is it the strict military life, or the life of an independent?\" Howard and his father are Iron Man fans, partly because Rhodes was one of the few black superheroes when Howard was a child. He has been a Downey fan since he saw him in Weird Science; the two competed physically on set. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane: Stark's business second-in-command, mentor, and friend, who turns on him to take over the company, eventually building a giant exosuit to fight Stark. Bridges read the comics as a boy and liked Favreau's modern, realistic approach. He shaved his head, something he had wanted to do for some time, and grew a beard for the role. Bridges researched the Book of Obadiah, and was surprised to learn retribution is a major theme in that book of the Bible, something that Stane represents. Many of Stane's scenes were cut to focus more on Stark, but the writers felt Bridges's performance allowed the application of \"less is more\" when editing the film. Gwyneth Paltrow as Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts: Stark's personal assistant and budding love interest. Paltrow asked Marvel to send her any comics they would consider relevant to her understanding of the character, whom she considered to be very smart, level-headed, and grounded. She said she liked \"the fact that there's a sexuality that's not blatant.\" Favreau wanted Potts' and Stark's relationship to be reminiscent of a 1940s comedy, something which Paltrow considered to be fun in an \"innocent yet sexy\" way. Leslie Bibb as Christine Everhart: A reporter for Vanity Fair. Shaun Toub as Ho Yinsen: Stark's fellow captive, who grafts an electromagnet to Stark's chest \"to keep the shrapnel shell shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him\" and helps Stark build the first Iron Man suit. Additionally, Faran Tahir appears as Raza, the leader of the Ten Rings; Paul Bettany voices J.A.R.V.I.S., Stark's personal AI system; and Clark Gregg appears as Phil Coulson, an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Will Lyman provides the voice-over during the opening award ceremony. Director Jon Favreau plays Harold \"Happy\" Hogan, Stark's bodyguard and chauffeur, and Samuel L. Jackson makes a cameo appearance as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., in a post-credits scene. Jackson's face was previously used as the model for the Ultimate Marvel imprint version of Nick Fury. Other cameos in the film include Stan Lee as himself, being mistaken for Hugh Hefner by Stark at a party; Peter Billingsley as William Ginter Riva, a scientist who works for Stane; Tom Morello, who provided guitar music for the film, as a terrorist guard; and Jim Cramer as himself. Ghostface Killah, who often adopted Iron Man's name as an alias, had a cameo in a scene where Stark stays in Dubai, but the scene was cut for pacing reasons. Production Development In April 1990, Universal Studios bought the rights to develop Iron Man for the big screen, with Stuart Gordon to direct a low-budget film based on the property. By February 1996, 20th Century Fox had acquired the rights from Universal. In January 1997, Nicolas Cage expressed interest in portraying the character, while in September 1998, Tom Cruise expressed interest in producing as well as starring in an Iron Man film. Jeff Vintar and Iron Man co-creator Stan Lee co-wrote a story for Fox, which Vintar adapted into a screenplay. It included a new science-fiction origin for the character, and featured MODOK as the villain. Tom Rothman, President of Production at Fox, credited the screenplay with finally making him understand the character. In May 1999, Jeffrey Caine was hired to rewrite Vintar and Lee's script. That October, Quentin Tarantino was approached to write and direct the film. Fox sold the rights to New Line Cinema the following December, reasoning that although the Vintar/Lee script was strong, the studio had too many Marvel superheroes in development, and \"we can't make them all.\" By July 2000, the film was being written for New Line by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, and Tim McCanlies. McCanlies' script used the idea of a Nick Fury cameo to set up his own film. In June 2001, New Line entered talks with Joss Whedon, a fan of the character, to direct, and in December 2002, McCanlies had turned in a completed script. New Line took a \"unique\" approach to writing the film's script, hiring David Hayter, David S. Goyer, and Mark Protosevich to \"sit in a room and simply talk on camera about Iron Man for a few days\". After this, Hayter was hired in 2004 to write a script. He reworked scripts that had been written by Jeff Vintar and Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, which had included the villain the Mandarin and Pepper Potts as a love interest. Hayter removed the Mandarin and instead chose to pit Iron Man against his father Howard Stark, who becomes War Machine. Hayter said \"you want to try to mirror your hero with your villain as much as possible\" for his reasoning behind making Howard the villain. He also made Bethany Cabe the film's love interest over Potts. In December 2004, the studio attached director Nick Cassavetes to the project for a target 2006 release. However, this deal ultimately fell through, and Iron Man's film rights returned to Marvel. In November 2005, Marvel Studios worked to start development from scratch, and announced Iron Man as their first independent feature, because the character was their only major one not already depicted in live action. According to associate producer Jeremy Latcham, \"we went after about 30 writers and they all passed,\" saying they were uninterested in the project due to both the relative obscurity of the character and the fact that it was solely a Marvel production. When the film did have a script, even the requests for rewrites met with many refusals. Early scripts for the film also directly referenced Sony Pictures' Spider-Man 2 (2004) by identifying Stark as the creator of Otto Octavius's bionic arms. In order to build the general public's awareness of Iron Man and elevate him to the same level of popularity as Spider-Man or Hulk, Marvel conducted focus groups, trying to find a way to remove the general perception that the character is a robot. The information Marvel received from the focus groups was used to formulate an awareness-building plan, which included releasing three animated short films ahead of the film's release. The shorts were called \"Iron Man Advertorials\", and were produced by Tim Miller and Blur Studio. Pre-production Jon Favreau was hired to direct the film in April 2006, celebrating getting the job by going on a diet, losing . Favreau had wanted to work with Marvel producer Avi Arad on another film after they both worked on Daredevil. The director found the opportunity to create a politically ambitious \"ultimate spy movie\" in Iron Man, citing inspiration from Tom Clancy, James Bond, and RoboCop, and compared his approach to an independent film—\"[i]f Robert Altman had directed Superman\"—and Batman Begins. Favreau wanted to make Iron Man a story of an adult man literally reinventing himself after discovering the world is far more complex than he originally believed. He changed the Vietnam War origin of the character to Afghanistan, as he did not want to do a period piece. Art Marcum & Matt Holloway were hired to write the script, while Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby wrote another version, with Favreau compiling both teams' scripts, and John August then \"polishing\" the combined version. Comic book staff Mark Millar, Brian Michael Bendis, Joe Quesada, Tom Brevoort, Axel Alonso, and Ralph Macchio were also called upon by Favreau to give advice on the script. By July 2006, Matthew Libatique was attached to serve as cinematographer. Favreau planned to cast a newcomer in the title role, as \"those movies don't require an expensive star; Iron Man's the star, the superhero is the star. The success of X-Men and Spider-Man without being star-driven pieces reassures [executives] that the film does have an upside commercially.\" However, before the screenplay was prepared he had approached Sam Rockwell to play the part. Rockwell was interested, but Favreau changed his decision after the screen-test of Robert Downey, Jr.; Rockwell would later portray Justin Hammer in Iron Man 2 (2010). In September 2006, Downey was cast in the role. Favreau chose Downey, a fan of the comic, because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part, explaining \"The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark.\" Favreau faced opposition from Marvel in casting Downey, but would not take no for an answer, saying, \"It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ... everybody knew he was talented [and] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert in all the good and bad ways.\" Downey earned $500,000 for the role. While preparing for filming, Favreau and Downey were given a tour of SpaceX by Elon Musk. Downey said, \"Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with, or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans.\" Additional casting for the film occurred over the next few months: Terrence Howard was announced in the role of Stark's best friend James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes in October 2006; Gwyneth Paltrow was cast as love interest Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts in January 2007; and Jeff Bridges was cast in an undisclosed role in February. Don Cheadle had also been approached for the role of Rhodes, and would eventually replace Howard in the role starting with the sequel, Iron Man 2. Choosing a character to be the villain of the film was difficult, as Favreau felt Iron Man's arch-nemesis the Mandarin would not feel realistic, especially after Mark Millar gave his opinion on the script. The Mandarin had originally been envisioned as a rival to Tony Stark with a building of his own right next to Stark Industries, with the Mandarin eventually drilling a hole underneath Stark Industries to steal all of Stark's technology for himself; associate producer Jeremy Latcham described such story as \"crazy terrible\" and \"underwhelming\". Favreau felt only in a sequel, with an altered tone, would the fantasy of the Mandarin's rings be appropriate. The decision to push him into the background is comparable to Sauron in The Lord of the Rings, or Palpatine in Star Wars. Favreau also wanted Iron Man to face a giant enemy. The switch from Mandarin to Obadiah Stane was done after Bridges was cast in that role, with Stane originally intended to become a villain in the sequel. The Crimson Dynamo was also a villain in early drafts of the script. Favreau felt it was important to include intentional inside references for fans of the comics, such as giving the two fighter jets that attack Iron Man the call signs of \"Whiplash 1\" and \"Whiplash 2\", a reference to the comic book villain Whiplash, and including Captain America's shield in Stark's workshop. Favreau wanted the film to be believable by showing the construction of the Iron Man suit in its three stages. Stan Winston, a fan of the comic book, and his company, who Favreau worked with on Zathura, built metal and rubber versions of the armor. The Mark I design was intended to look like it was built from spare parts. The back is less armored than the front, because Stark would use his resources for a forward attack. It also foreshadows the design of Stane's armor. A single version was built, causing concern when a stuntman fell over inside it, though both the stuntman and the suit were unscathed. The armor was also designed to have only its top half worn at times. Stan Winston Studios built a , animatronic version of Iron Monger (Obadiah Stane), a name which Obadiah Stane calls Tony Stark and himself earlier in the film as a reference, but is never actually used for the suit itself in the film. The animatronic required five operators for the arm, and was built on a gimbal to simulate walking. A scale model was used for the shots of it being built. The Mark II resembles an airplane prototype, with visible flaps. Iron Man comic book artist Adi Granov designed the Mark III with illustrator Phil Saunders. Granov's designs were the primary inspiration for the film's, and he came on board the film after he recognized his work on Jon Favreau's MySpace page. Saunders streamlined Granov's concept art, making it stealthier and less cartoonish in its proportions, and also designed the War Machine armor, but it was \"cut from the script about halfway through pre-production.\" He explained that the War Machine armor \"was going to be called the Mark IV armor and would have had weaponized swap-out parts that would be worn over the original Mark III armor,\" and that it \"would have been worn by Tony Stark in the final battle sequence.\" Filming Production was based in the former Hughes Company soundstages in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California. Howard Hughes was one of the inspirations for the comic book, and the filmmakers acknowledged the coincidence that they would film Iron Man creating the flying Mark III where the Hughes H-4 Hercules was built. Favreau rejected the East Coast setting of the comic books because many superhero films had already been set there. Filming began on March 12, 2007, with Matthew Libatique serving as director of photography. The first few weeks of filming were spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan. The cave where Stark is imprisoned was a long set, which had movable forks in the caverns to allow greater freedom for the film's crew. Production designer J. Michael Riva saw footage of a Taliban fighter in Afghanistan, and saw the cold breath as he spoke: realizing remote caves are actually very cold, Riva placed an air conditioning system in the set. He also sought Downey's advice about makeshift objects in prison, such as a sock being used to make tea. Afterwards, Stark's capture was filmed at Lone Pine, and other exterior scenes in Afghanistan were filmed at Olancha Sand Dunes, where the crew endured two days of winds. Filming at Edwards Air Force Base began in mid-April, and ended on May 2. In return for production assistance, the United States Department of Defense consulted on the film regarding certain scenes and dialogue depicting the military. This included changing Stark from being opposed to arms deals, to instead becoming one who sells his technology to the U.S. military. Exterior shots of Stark's home were digitally added to footage of Point Dume in Malibu, while the interior was built at Playa Vista, where Favreau and Riva aimed to make Stark's home look less futuristic and more \"grease monkey\". Filming concluded on June 25, 2007, at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. Favreau, a newcomer to action films, remarked, \"I'm shocked that I [was] on schedule. I thought that there were going to be many curveballs\". He hired \"people who are good at creating action\", so \"the human story [felt] like it belongs to the comic book genre\". There was much improvisation in dialogue scenes, because the script was not completed when filming began (the filmmakers had focused on the story making sense and planning the action). Favreau felt that improvisation would make the film feel more natural. Some scenes were shot with two cameras to capture lines said on the spot. Multiple takes were done, as Downey wanted to try something new each time. It was Downey's idea to have Stark hold a news conference on the floor, and he created the speech Stark makes when demonstrating the Jericho weapon. Bridges described this approach as \"a $200 million student film\", and noted that it caused stress for Marvel executives when the stars were trying to come up with dialogue on the day of filming scenes. He also noted that in some instances, he and Downey would swap characters for rehearsal to see how their own lines sounded. The crew conceived a post-credits scene featuring Nick Fury and called Samuel L. Jackson to ask him if he would be interest in playing Fury, as Jackson had learned a few years ago that his likeness had been used for Fury in the Ultimate Marvel imprint. However, according to Latchman, Jackson originally appeared without any deal for him to reappear in later movies: \"It was just this weird idea that maybe people give a shi-- if we stick it on the end\". The dialogue for the Nick Fury cameo scene was also changed on set, with comic writer Brian Michael Bendis providing three pages of dialogue for the part, and the filmmakers choosing the best lines for filming on set. The Nick Fury cameo was filmed with a skeleton crew in order to keep it a secret, but rumors appeared on the Internet only days later. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige subsequently had the scene removed from all preview prints in order to maintain the surprise and keep fans guessing. An alternate version of the Nick Fury post-credits scene was filmed in which he specifically said \"As if gamma accidents, radioactive bugs bites and assorted mutants weren't enough\" referencing Hulk, Spider-Man and the X-Men but this was cut due to legal problems with Sony Pictures and 20th Century Fox who at the time had full ownership of the characters until their reacquisition much later in the mid to late 2010s. Post-production Favreau's main concern with the film's effects was whether the transition between the computer-generated and practical costumes would be too obvious. He hired Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) to create the bulk of the visual effects for the film after seeing Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End and Transformers. The Orphanage and The Embassy did additional work, with the latter creating a digital version of the Mark I armor. To help with animating the more refined suits, information was sometimes captured by having Downey wear only the helmet, sleeves and chest of the costume over a motion capture suit, and skydivers were filmed in a vertical wind tunnel to study the physics of flying. For shots of the Mark III flying, it was animated to look realistic by taking off slowly, and landing quickly. To generate shots of Iron Man and the F-22 Raptors battling, cameras were flown in the air to provide reference for physics, wind and frost on the lenses. Music Composer Ramin Djawadi had been a fan of the character Iron Man as a child, saying that he always liked superheroes \"that actually don't have any superpowers\". After Favreau's previous collaborator John Debney was unavailable to score the film, Djawadi sought out the role himself. Favreau had a clear vision of heavy metal music and guitars for the project, saying that Tony Stark was more of a rock star than a traditional superhero. Djawadi subsequently composed most of the film's score on guitar, before arranging it for orchestra. Djawadi had help with arrangements and additional cues from Hans Zimmer and Remote Control Productions, and Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, who also makes a cameo appearance in the film, contributed guitar performances to the score. The film also features a big band-style arrangement of the Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon The Marvel Super Heroes from frequent Favreau collaborators John O'Brien and Rick Boston. A soundtrack featuring Djawadi's score was released by Lions Gate Records on April 29, 2008. Marketing In July 2006, with the film still in pre-production, Favreau and Arad attended San Diego Comic-Con to promote the film, where the film's armor design, drawn by Adi Granov, was revealed along with the announcement that the Mandarin was intended to be the antagonist of the film. The following year, Favreau returned to San Diego Comic-Con to once again promote the film with Downey and Feige, where a teaser trailer was shown. With much of the visuals not yet ready, Favreau worked with ILM to have the flying shots ready, saying \"I knew that I had to make a splash because there was zero anticipation for the film at the time\". Stan Winston Studios also brought a life-sized replica of the film's armor to display at the convention. Marvel and Paramount modeled their marketing campaign for Iron Man on that of Transformers. In May 2008, Sega released an official tie-in video game based on the film on multiple gaming platforms. Downey, Howard and Toub reprise their roles from the film. A 30-second spot for the film aired during a Super Bowl XLII break. Hasbro created figures of armor from the film, as well as Titanium Man (who appears in the video game) and the armor from the World War Hulk comics. The 7-Eleven convenience store chain helped promote the film across the United States, and LG Group also made a sponsorship deal with Paramount. Worldwide, Burger King and Audi promoted the film. Jon Favreau was set to direct a commercial for the fast-food chain, as Michael Bay did for Transformers. In the film, Tony Stark drives an Audi R8, and also has an \"American cheeseburger\" from Burger King after his rescue from Afghanistan, as part of the studio's product placement deal with the respective companies. Three other vehicles, the Audi S6 sedan, Audi S5 sports coupe and the Audi Q7 SUV, also appear in the film. Audi created a tie-in website, as General Motors did for Transformers. Oracle Corporation also promoted the film on its site. Several tie-in comics were released for the film. Release Theatrical Iron Man premiered at the Greater Union theater at George Street, Sydney, on April 14, 2008. The film began releasing in international markets on April 30, and was released in the United States on May 2, 2008. Iron Man was the first film released in Phase One of the MCU. The film was re-formatted and screened in IMAX for the first time on August 30, 2018, as part of Marvel Studios' 10th anniversary IMAX festival. Home media The film was released by Paramount Home Entertainment on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on September 30, 2008, in the United States and Canada, and October 27, 2008 in most of Europe. DVD sales were very successful, selling over 4 million copies the first week and generating a gross of over US$93 million. There were a total of 9 million copies sold and an accumulated total sales of over $160 million (not including Blu-ray). For the home releases of the film, the image on the newspaper Stark reads before he announces he is Iron Man had to be altered because of amateur photographer Ronnie Adams filing a lawsuit against Paramount and Marvel for using his on-location spy photo in the scene. A Walmart-exclusive DVD release included a preview of Iron Man: Armored Adventures. The film was also collected in a 10-disc box set titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One – Avengers Assembled\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on April 2, 2013. The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021. Reception Box office Iron Man earned $319 million in the United States and Canada and $266.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $585.8 million. In its opening weekend, Iron Man grossed $98.6 million in 4,105 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking first at the box office, giving it the eleventh biggest-opening weekend at the time, ninth-widest release in terms of theaters, and the third highest-grossing opening weekend of 2008 behind Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and The Dark Knight. It grossed $35.2 million on its first day, giving it the thirteenth biggest-opening day at the time. Iron Man had the second-best premiere for a non-sequel, behind Spider-Man, and the fourth biggest-opening for a superhero film. Iron Man was also the number one film in the United States and Canada in its second weekend, grossing $51.2 million, giving it the twelfth-best second weekend and the fifth-best for a non-sequel. On June 19, 2008, Iron Man became that year's first film to pass the $300 million mark for the domestic box office. Critical response The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of , with an average score of , based on reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Powered by Robert Downey Jr.'s vibrant charm, Iron Man turbo-charges the superhero genre with a deft intelligence and infectious sense of fun.\" On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 79 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Among the major trade journals, Todd McCarthy of Variety called the film an \"expansively entertaining special effects extravaganza\" with \"fresh energy and stylistic polish\", while Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film, while nonetheless finding \"disappointment [in] a climatic battle between different Iron Man prototypes ... how did Tony's nemesis learn how to use the suit?\" In one of the first major-daily newspaper reviews, Frank Lovece of Newsday lauded the film's \"emotional truth ... pitch-perfect casting and plausibly rendered super-science\" that made it \"faithful to the source material while updating it – and recognizing what's made that material so enduring isn't just the high-tech cool of a man in a metal suit, but the human condition that got him there\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, praising Downey Jr.'s performance and stating, \"At the end of the day it's Robert Downey Jr. who powers the lift-off separating this from most other superhero movies\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film \"an unusually good superhero picture. Or at least – since it certainly has its problems – a superhero movie that's good in unusual ways.\" Among the specialty press, Garth Franklin of Dark Horizons commended the \"impressive sets and mechanics that combine smoothly with relatively seamless CG\", and said, \"Robert Downey Jr., along with director Jon Favreau ... help this rise above formula. The result is something that, whilst hardly original or groundbreaking, is nevertheless refreshing in its earnestness to avoid dark dramatic stylings in favor of an easy-going, crowd-pleasing action movie with a sprinkle of anti-war and redemption themes\". Among major metropolitan weeklies, David Edelstein of New York magazine called the film \"a shapely piece of mythmaking ... Favreau doesn't go in for stylized comic-book frames, at least in the first half. He gets real with it – you'd think you were watching a military thriller\", while conversely, David Denby of The New Yorker gave a negative review, claiming \"a slightly depressed, going-through-the-motions feel to the entire show ... Gwyneth Paltrow, widening her eyes and palpitating, can't do much with an antique role as Stark's girl Friday, who loves him but can't say so; Terrence Howard, playing a military man who chases around after Stark, looks dispirited and taken for granted\". IGN's Todd Gilchrist recognized Downey as \"the best thing\" in a film that \"functions on autopilot, providing requisite story developments and character details to fill in this default 'origin story' while the actors successfully breathe life into their otherwise conventional roles\". Accolades Roger Ebert and Richard Corliss named Iron Man as among their favorite films of 2008. It was selected by the American Film Institute as one of the ten best films of the year and by Empire magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. Tony Stark was also selected by Empire as one of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time, and on their list of the 100 Greatest Fictional Characters, Fandomania.com ranked him at number 37. The Library of Congress selected Iron Man to be added to the National Film Registry in 2022, deeming it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Responding to the selection, Feige stated its inclusion on the Film Registry meant the film \"has stood the test of time and that it is still meaningful to audiences around the world\".

{"text": "The 2000 SummerSlam was the 13th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 27, 2000, at the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina. Ten matches were contested at the event. The main event was a triple threat match for the WWF Championship involving champion The Rock, Triple H, and Kurt Angle. The Rock won the match and retained the title after pinning Triple H following a People's Elbow. One of the predominant matches on the undercard was Kane versus The Undertaker, which ended in a no contest after Undertaker ripped Kane's mask off which caused Kane to flee. Another featured match on the undercard was the first Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the Tag Team Championship involving champions Edge and Christian, The Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy), and The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley). Edge and Christian won the match by retrieving the belts suspended above the ring. Production Background SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2000 event was the 13th event in the SummerSlam chronology and was scheduled to be held on August 27, 2000, at the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina. Storylines The professional wrestling matches at SummerSlam featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Storylines between the characters played out on WWF's primary television programs, Raw Is War and SmackDown!. On the August 3 episode of SmackDown!, Triple H and his wife, Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, along with Kurt Angle, were booked in a six-man tag team match by Commissioner Mick Foley, against the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) and Lita which Triple H, McMahon, and Angle won. After the match, as Triple H left the ring, Angle and McMahon hugged in a victory celebration, frustrating Triple H and marking the beginning of a Triple H-Angle feud. On the August 7 edition of Raw is War, Angle and Triple H were booked in a triple threat match, along with Chris Jericho, to determine the number one contender for a WWF Championship match against the defending champion, The Rock. Both Angle and Triple H simultaneously pinned Jericho, which made both Angle and Triple H co-number one contenders; in frustration, Rock delivered a Rock Bottom on Triple H, Angle, and McMahon, who was at ringside during the match. Later that week on SmackDown!, the match was made official for SummerSlam by Commissioner Foley. He also booked a tag team match, where Angle and Triple H would team up against Rock and The Undertaker. During the match, Angle accidentally attacked Triple H, causing Triple H to walk out on the match and a loss for Angle. The following week on Raw is War, Angle, Triple H, and Shane McMahon were booked in a six-man tag team match against the Dudley Boyz and Rock, with the stipulation that if Angle or Triple H walked away from the match, they would lose their number one contender status. During the match, Edge and Christian interfered by attacking the Dudley Boyz, which resulted in Angle, Triple H, and McMahon winning the match when Triple H pinned Rock; as a result of neither Triple H nor Angle walking out on the match, they both were able to keep their number one contender status. On the August 14 edition of Raw is War, Kane interfered in a match between The Undertaker and Chris Benoit and chokeslammed The Undertaker. After the interference, Kane rode out of the arena with The Undertaker's motorcycle, which was at ringside, signaling the start of a feud between The Undertaker and Kane, which was the second main feud heading into SummerSlam. On the August 17 edition of Smackdown, the feud intensified during a segment in which Kane attacked The Undertaker with a steel chair, bloodying The Undertaker. On the August 20 edition of Sunday Night Heat, it was made official that The Undertaker would face Kane at SummerSlam. On the August 10 episode of SmackDown!, the Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) attacked the WWF Tag Team Champions, Edge and Christian, after their championship match against the Dudley Boyz. As the Hardy Boyz attacked Edge with a ladder, the Dudley Boyz powerbombed Christian through a table; this began a three-way feud, the third main rivalry heading into SummerSlam. The feud intensified on the August 14 edition of Raw is War, when Edge and Christian attacked Matt Hardy with steel chairs after the Hardy Boyz' match against Right to Censor. Later that night, Commissioner Mick Foley announced a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match between the three teams in a WrestleMania 2000 rematch for the WWF Tag Team Championship. On that week's edition of SmackDown!, Jeff teamed up with D-Von to face Edge and Christian. During the match, Jeff accidentally delivered a Swanton Bomb to D-Von, which resulted in Edge pinning D-Von for the win. After the match, Matt and Bubba came down to the ring, and the Hardys and the Dudleys brawled until they were pulled apart by WWF officials. Due to the events that occurred that past week, the Hardy Boyz were booked in a match against the Dudley Boyz the following week on Raw is War, which the Hardys won. On the final episode of SmackDown! prior to SummerSlam, the Dudley Boyz interfered in a six-man tag team match between the team of the Hardy Boyz and Chris Jericho and the team of Edge, Christian, and Chris Benoit, which resulted in another brawl between the three teams. The interference allowed Jericho to pin Edge for the win. On the July 27 episode of SmackDown!, Chris Jericho and Lita defeated Chris Benoit and Trish Stratus in a mixed tag team match when Jericho pinned Benoit. Backstage after the match, Jericho in an interview mocked Benoit's claim of being the best \"technical wrestler in the world\" when Benoit viciously attacked Jericho from behind and threw him under a steel door before slamming it on his injured ribs. As Jericho coughed up blood, Benoit hit him with a steel chair. On the August 7 episode of Raw is War, Benoit challenged The Rock for the WWF Championship in a no disqualification match. As Benoit was putting the Crippler Crossface on Rock, Jericho interfered in the match and attacked Benoit before running off Shane McMahon who attempted to interfere in the match on Benoit's behalf. Rock retained the title after a Rock Bottom. When Benoit and Shane complained to Commissioner Foley about Jericho's interference, Foley put Jericho in the number one contender's match with Triple H and Kurt Angle which Jericho would lose when both men pinned him simultaneously. On the August 10 episode of SmackDown!, Benoit and Intercontinental Champion Val Venis defeated Jericho and Eddie Guerrero when Benoit pinned Guerrero after a Diving Headbutt. After the match, Jericho attacked Benoit and put him in the Walls of Jericho. When Shane tried to make the save, Jericho put him in the same maneuver. Later that night, Jericho demanded a match against Benoit which Foley made for SummerSlam. The weeks leading up to the match would see Benoit and Jericho attacking each other and interfering in title matches by one costing the other. The match was later announced to be a Two-out-of-three falls match. Event Preliminary matches The first match that aired was a six-man tag team match between the team of Right to Censor (The Goodfather, Steven Richards, and Bull Buchanan) and Too Cool (Rikishi, Scotty 2 Hotty, and Grandmaster Sexay). Too Cool gained the early advantage, but The Goodfather retaliated by hitting a Big Boot on Sexay. Right to Censor continued with the advantage until midway into the match, when Richards attempted an aerial technique. Sexay, however, crotched Richards on the top turnbuckle and Superplexed him. Hotty was then tagged into the match, where he attempted to deliver a Worm to no avail, as Richards delivered a superkick on Hotty before pinning him to win the match. The next match was the encounter of Road Dogg and X-Pac. Both men fought back and forth in the beginning of the match, but Dogg gained the advantage after countering an X-Factor into a powerbomb. Although Dogg had the advantage, X-Pac retaliated by successfully hitting a low blow and another X-Factor into a pinfall and winning the match. After the match, Road Dogg hit X-Pac with a pumphandle slam and performed some crotch chops. The third match was an Intercontinental Championship Intergender Tag Team match between the team of Trish Stratus and defending champion Val Venis against the team of Chyna and Eddie Guerrero. In this match, the wrestler who gained the first pinfall would become the Intercontinental Champion. Guerrero and Chyna gained the early advantage in the match, but as Guerrero attempted a Hurricanrana, Venis countered it into a powerbomb. As the men tagged in the women, Chyna delivered a Military Press Slam on Stratus into a pinfall, winning the match for the team of herself and Guerrero. Due to pre-match stipulations, Chyna became the new Intercontinental Champion. The next match was the encounter of Jerry Lawler and Tazz. The match began as Tazz gained the advantage, but Lawler retaliated by delivering a piledriver on Tazz. As Tazz recuperated, he applied the Tazzmission on Lawler; in desperation, Jim Ross, the commentating partner of Lawler, hit Tazz with a glass jar, breaking it over his head and allowing Lawler to pin Tazz for the win. The fifth match was a Hardcore Championship match between Steve Blackman and the defending champion, Shane McMahon. Blackman had the advantage over McMahon midway into the match, until Test and Albert interfered on McMahon's behalf by double teaming Blackman. Nevertheless, Blackman retaliated as he hit both men with a kendo stick, which allowed McMahon to attempt an escape from the ring. Blackman then chased McMahon until both men were on a high steel structure, which was a part of the stage set. Blackman then hit McMahon with a kendo stick three times, causing him to fall from the steel structure onto the arena concrete floor. After the fall, Blackman performed an Elbow drop and got a pinfall to win the match and the Hardcore Championship. The next match was a two out of three falls match between Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho. In the midst of the action, Jericho attempted a Lionsault, which Benoit countered into a Crippler Crossface, forcing Jericho to submit and winning the first fall. After the first fall, Benoit retained the advantage, but after he delivered two Belly to Belly suplexes, Jericho countered a third one into the Walls of Jericho, forcing Benoit to submit and allowing Jericho to win his first fall (the second fall in the match). As Benoit and Jericho fought back and forth, Benoit countered a Cradle by Jericho into one of his own, and he pinned Jericho by holding on to the ring ropes for leverage to win his second fall (the third fall overall) and the match. Main event matches The seventh match was the first triple threat tag team Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the Tag Team Championship between the team of the Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy), Edge and Christian, and the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley). The Dudley Boyz gained an advantage in the match when they delivered a 3-D on Christian through a table. Jeff Hardy then attempted a Swanton Bomb on Bubba through a table, but it backfired when Bubba moved and Jeff went through the table. Subsequently, Edge and Christian knocked Bubba off of a ladder outside of the ring, through four double-stacked tables. Lita, the associate of the Hardy Boyz, then came down to the ring, pushing Edge and Christian off a ladder. This allowed Matt to climb a ladder to retrieve the championship belts, but D-Von pushed the ladder, resulting in Matt falling at ringside through two double-stacked tables. Lita came to check on Matt, but she was brutally speared by Edge in retaliation and was taken out of the match. D-Von then climbed another ladder, along with Jeff, but Edge and Christian knocked the ladder over, leaving Jeff and D-Von hanging on the belt; Jeff then kicked D-Von a few times, causing the latter to fall into the ring. Jeff was eventually hit with a ladder by Christian and fell into the ring, allowing Edge and Christian to climb another ladder and retrieve the championship belts to retain the Tag Team Championship. The next match was a Stinkface match between The Kat and Terri. After back and forth action between the two women, The Kat gained the advantage after she performed a powerslam on Terri and then threw Terri into the turnbuckle and delivered a Stinkface on her for the win. The final match on the undercard was the encounter of Kane and The Undertaker. Before the match began, Kane attacked The Undertaker on the ring aisle. Kane then attempted to attack The Undertaker with the steel ring steps, but The Undertaker retaliated by avoiding the attack. Kane then performed a low blow on The Undertaker, who retaliated by delivering a Spear and ripping Kane's mask off, which resulted in Kane exiting the ring to the backstage area, ending the match with no winner. The final match of the night was a WWF Championship Triple-Threat match between Triple H, Kurt Angle, and the defending champion, The Rock. Before The Rock made his entrance, Angle and Triple H fought at ringside, with Triple H delivering a Pedigree on Angle on the commentator's announce table, which broke prematurely, resulting in Angle being injured with a concussion though he was to have been (kayfabe) out of the match during this time anyway. After the incident, The Rock made his entrance down to the ring. He wrestled Triple H as Angle was attended by EMTs, who transported Angle backstage. Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley then came down to the ring and attempted to interfere by hitting The Rock with the WWF Championship belt. She accidentally hit Triple H, however, which resulted in Triple H ordering McMahon to the backstage area. Angle returned to the ring midway through the match, alongside McMahon, and attacked Triple H. As Triple H recuperated, Angle called McMahon to give him a sledgehammer, but Angle and Triple H brawled over the sledgehammer, resulting in Triple H accidentally hitting McMahon. This situation allowed The Rock to throw Angle over the top rope onto ringside and deliver a People's Elbow on Triple H into a pinfall to win the match and retain the WWF Championship. Reception In 2006, J.D. Dunn of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 8.5 [Very Good], writing, \"This was the height of the WWF as former \"Daily Show\" writer Chris Kreski booked one of the more compelling soap opera angles in WWE history. Unlike what Russo did, Kreski's stuff was always streamlined so it never spun out of control or lost focus like so many Russo angles. Plus, with Jericho and the Radicalz in the WWF, there was now enough actual talent to put some wrestling on their wrestling show. Imagine that. Most of the matches are throwaways, but the right people were put in the right places to do the right matches, and that's where the entertainment comes from. Solid thumbs up.\" Aftermath The Kurt Angle–Triple H feud would continue after SummerSlam. On the first episode of Raw is War after SummerSlam, Angle interfered in a match between Triple H and Eddie Guerrero by attacking both men with a steel chair. The feud intensified once more, as Triple H and Angle brawled on the September 11 episode of Raw is War after a match between Triple H and Chris Jericho. Later that night, Commissioner Mick Foley booked a match between Angle and Triple H at Unforgiven. The following week on Raw is War, Foley announced that he would be the Special Guest Referee for the match between Triple H and Angle. On the final episode of SmackDown! before Unforgiven, the feud escalated when Angle attacked Triple H with a sledgehammer, resulting in Triple H becoming unconscious and allowing Angle to kiss Triple H's wife, Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, who was at ringside. At Unforgiven, Triple H pinned Angle after a Pedigree. After SummerSlam, a feud began between Kane, The Undertaker, The Rock, and Chris Benoit over the WWF Championship. Kane and The Undertaker continued to feud on the August 28 episode of Raw is War, where The Undertaker interfered in a WWF Championship match between Kane and The Rock (the winner of the match). The feud between Kane and Benoit began on the September 4 episode of Raw is War during a WWF Championship number one contender's match, as Benoit attacked Kane with a steel chair. The feud between Kane and The Rock began later that week on SmackDown!, when Kane chokeslammed The Rock through the commentator's announce table. The following week on Raw is War, the feud between Kane, Benoit, The Undertaker, and The Rock officially began, as Kane, Benoit, and The Undertaker cut promos about how they deserved to face The Rock at Unforgiven for the WWF Championship. The situation resulted in a brawl between all four wrestlers. Later that night, Commissioner Foley announced that a Fatal-Four Way match would take place at Unforgiven for the WWF Championship. At Unforgiven, The Rock retained the WWF Championship after he performed a Rock Bottom on Benoit into a pinfall. The feud between the Hardy Boyz and Edge and Christian over the WWF Tag Team Championship continued after SummerSlam. On the Raw is War edition after SummerSlam, the Hardy Boyz and Edge and Christian brawled throughout the night on different occasions. On the September 11 edition of Raw is War, The Hardy Boyz defeated the Dudley Boyz in a tag team match to become the number one contenders for the WWF Tag Team Championship. The following week on SmackDown!, Commissioner Foley announced a Steel Cage match for the WWF Tag Team Championship at Unforgiven, between the teams of Edge and Christian and the Hardy Boyz. At Unforgiven, The Hardy Boyz escaped the Steel Cage to win the match and the WWF Tag Team Championship. After the Dudley Boyz were unable to win the number one contender's match, they were involved in a short-lived feud with the A.P.A, as the Dudley Boyz defeated the A.P.A on the September 4 edition of Raw is War. The defeat led to the A.P.A challenging the Dudley Boyz into a Bar Room Brawl, which ended in a no contest. After the match, The Dudley Boyz and the A.P.A united as they drank beer and attacked Kai En Tai. The Dudley Boyz then began a feud with the Right to Censor on the September 18 edition of Raw is War, where after losing a match to the Dudley Boyz, all four members of Right to Censor attacked them. The attack led to the A.P.A coming down to the ring to help the Dudley Boyz. On the September 21 edition of SmackDown!, Commissioner Foley announced an eight-man tag team match between the team of Right to Censor against the team of the Dudley Boyz and the A.P.A at Unforgiven. At Unforgiven, Right to Censor defeated the Dudley Boyz and the A.P.A.

{"text": "The 2001 SummerSlam was the 14th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 19, 2001, at the Compaq Center at San Jose in San Jose, California. It was the last SummerSlam promoted under the WWF name, as the promotion was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May 2002. It was also the last SummerSlam held before the introduction of the brand extension in March 2002. In the main event, The Rock defeated Booker T for the WCW Championship, after executing a Rock Bottom. The other two main matches on the card were Steve Austin versus Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship, which Angle won, after Austin was disqualified for attacking referees, and Rob Van Dam defeated Jeff Hardy in a ladder match for the WWF Hardcore Championship. The other main match on the undercard was the Winners Take All Steel cage match between WCW Tag Team Champions Undertaker and Kane and WWF Tag Team Champions Diamond Dallas Page and Kanyon, which Undertaker and Kane won, after Undertaker executed the Last Ride and pinned Page to win both titles. Production Background SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2001 event was the 14th SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 19, 2001, at the Compaq Center at San Jose in San Jose, California. Storylines The main rivalry heading into SummerSlam was between The Rock and Booker T, battling over the WCW Championship. After losing the WWF Championship to Steve Austin at WrestleMania X-Seven, The Rock took a hiatus from professional wrestling to film the movie The Scorpion King. On the July 9, 2001 edition of Raw Is War, campaigning for The Rock's return began. Following the campaigning, The Rock returned to the WWF on the July 30, 2001 edition of Raw Is War, where he chose to align himself with the WWF instead of The Alliance for The Invasion. This action was shown by The Rock delivering a Rock Bottom and the People's Elbow onto Shane McMahon, The Alliance leader. Later that week on SmackDown!, Booker T and The Rock cut a promo, where Booker T challenged The Rock to a match at SummerSlam; the beginning of the Rock-Booker T rivalry. Seeking revenge for the attack from the previous week, McMahon fought The Rock in a Street Fight on the August 6 edition of Raw Is War, where The Rock pinned McMahon. The rivalry between The Rock and Booker T intensified after the match, where Booker T and Shane McMahon double-teamed The Rock. Later that week on SmackDown!, in retaliation, The Rock accepted Booker T's challenge. On the August 13 edition of Raw Is War, The Rock was involved in a tag team match, where he teamed with Chris Jericho in a loss to Booker T and Rhyno. After the match, Booker T delivered his variation of the Rock Bottom on The Rock, a move dubbed, The Book End. On the final edition of SmackDown! before SummerSlam, McMahon announced that Booker T would defend the WCW Championship at SummerSlam against The Rock. Later that night, the rivalry continued to intensify during a Lights Out match between Booker T and The Rock, after Booker T delivered a Book End onto The Rock through a commentators announce table.

The previous month at Invasion, Team WCW/ECW (Booker T, Diamond Dallas Page, Rhyno and Bubba Ray and D-Von Dudley) defeated Team WWF (Austin, Angle, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker and Kane). Team WCW/ECW won after Austin turned on the WWF when he executed a Stunner on Angle. On the following night's edition of Raw Is War, Austin stated that he did this because he felt that Vince McMahon was grooming Angle to take over his spot, and that he was \"unappreciated\" when McMahon insisted he return to the old Austin. Later that evening, Austin interfered during a six man Elimination Tables match by assaulting Angle. Then on the July 26, 2001 edition of SmackDown!, Angle appeared in his hometown of Pittsburgh and challenged Austin for the WWF Championship but Austin instead chose Booker T to defend his WCW Championship against Angle. Later on that night, Angle won the WCW Championship from Booker despite Austin's interference. On the July 30, 2001 edition of Raw Is War, Angle lost the WCW Championship back to Booker with the help of Austin and Shane McMahon. Afterwards, Angle challenged Austin for the WWF Championship at SummerSlam, which Austin accepted. The feud between Austin and Angle would escalate in the following couple of weeks leading up to SummerSlam especially in a Six Man Tag Team Elimination match pitting Austin and the Dudley Boyz against Angle and The Hardy Boyz, which Austin and the Dudley Boyz won. Another main match heading into the event was Jeff Hardy versus Rob Van Dam in a Ladder match for the WWF Hardcore Championship. At Invasion Van Dam defeated Hardy to win the Hardcore Championship. In the following weeks, Van Dam and Hardy faced each other in Tag Team matches. On the August 13 edition of Raw, Van Dam was scheduled to defend his title against Kurt Angle, and as the match was underway, Hardy interfered and pinned Van Dam to win the title for himself. This led to a Ladder match for the title at SummerSlam between Hardy and Van Dam. Event Before the event began, a dark match took place on Heat. The match was originally a handicap match featuring Lita and Jacqueline against Torrie Wilson, Stacy Keibler, and Ivory. Backstage, Wilson, Ivory and Keibler attacked Lita, preventing her from competing. Molly Holly replaced Lita. Lita performed the Twist of Fate on Ivory, allowing Jacqueline to pin her for the win.

However; Rock quickly got up with a kip-up, no-selling the attack, and performed a Rock Bottom on Booker to win the Championship, his seventh World Championship overall and first WCW Championship reign. Reception In 2013, Dylan Diot of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 8.5 [Very Good], writing, \"This was a damn good edition of Summerslam. Nothing on the show was bad and two of the matches were absolutely outstanding. [This] show is well worth a watch, especially for Angle's memorable performance and another classic ladder match. The Invasion angle may have [sucked], but at least the effort in the ring was great.\" Aftermath This was the last SummerSlam to occur before the introduction of the first brand extension in March 2002, which split the roster between the Raw and SmackDown! brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. It was also the last SummerSlam event to occur under the WWF name, as the promotion was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May 2002. Additionally, King of the Ring was discontinued as a PPV following its 2002 event, thus SummerSlam, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, reverted to being called the \"Big Four\" until October 2021 when Money in the Bank was recognized as one of the \"Big Five\". With the WWF's purchase of rival company World Championship Wrestling (WCW) back in March, some of their titles became defended on WWF programming. As such, the 2001 event was the only SummerSlam to feature the WCW Championship, as the title was unified with the WWF Championship at December's Vengeance event with the latter being renamed to Undisputed WWF Championship. It was also the only SummerSlam to feature the WCW Tag Team Championship, which was unified with the WWF Tag Team Championship at Survivor Series in November. It was also the first SummerSlam to feature the WCW Cruiserweight Championship and the last to feature the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship, which was dropped in March 2002 in favor of continuing the Cruiserweight Championship, which was rebranded as a WWF title.

{"text": "The siege of Adrianople () in 813 was a part of the wars of the Byzantine Empire with the Bulgarian khan Krum (Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars). It began soon after the Byzantine field army was defeated in the battle of Versinikia on 22 June. At first the besieging force was commanded by Krum's brother (whose name is not mentioned in the primary sources). The khan himself went on with an army to besiege Constantinople. After an unsuccessful Byzantine attempt to murder him ruined all prospects for negotiations with them, Krum ravaged much of Eastern Thrace and then turned against Adrianople which was still under siege. The city—one of the most important Byzantine fortresses in Thrace—held out for a while despite being attacked with siege engines. Yet, without any help from outside, the garrison was forced to capitulate due to starvation. On Krum's order the population of Adrianople and the surrounding area (numbering about 10,000) was transferred to Bulgarian territory north of the Danube. Under the peace treaty, concluded in 815, Adrianople remained in the Byzantine empire. Sources Runciman, Steven: A history of the First Bulgarian Empire , G.

{"text": "The 2002 SummerSlam was the 15th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place on August 25, 2002, at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York. With this event, SummerSlam became the first pay-per-view to have events in the three major indoor venues in the New York metropolitan area. Madison Square Garden hosted the event in 1988, 1991, and 1998, and the Izod Center in East Rutherford, New Jersey hosted the event in 1989, 1997, and later in 2007. This was also the first SummerSlam held under the WWE name, after the promotion was renamed from World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to WWE in May, and the first SummerSlam held following the introduction of the brand extension in March. The main match on the SmackDown! brand was for the WWE Undisputed Championship between The Rock and Brock Lesnar. Lesnar won the match and the championship after pinning Rock following an F-5. The main match on the Raw brand featured an Unsanctioned Street Fight between the returning Shawn Michaels and Triple H, which Michaels won after pinning Triple H by reversing Triple H's Pedigree attempt into a jackknife roll-up. There was also an interpromotional match for the Intercontinental Championship between Rob Van Dam from Raw and Chris Benoit from SmackDown!, which Van Dam won by pinfall after performing a Five-Star Frog Splash. The other matches on the undercard included The Undertaker versus Test and Kurt Angle versus Rey Mysterio. SummerSlam 2002 is widely regarded among fans and critics as the greatest SummerSlam of all time as well as one of the greatest professional wrestling pay-per-views of all time, often receiving comparisons to WrestleMania X-Seven from the previous year in 2001. Production Background SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\", and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring until its discontinuation after its 2002 event. It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2002 event was the 15th SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 25, 2002, at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York. It was the first SummerSlam to occur under the first brand extension introduced in March, which split the roster between the Raw and SmackDown! brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform; SummerSlam featured wrestlers from both brands. It was also the first SummerSlam to occur under the WWE name, following the promotion being renamed from World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to WWE in May. Storylines The professional wrestling matches at SummerSlam featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Storylines between the characters were produced on WWE's weekly television shows Raw and SmackDown! with the Raw and SmackDown! brands—storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees to different programs. SmackDown! The main feud heading into SummerSlam on the SmackDown! brand was between The Rock and Brock Lesnar, with the two feuding over the WWE Undisputed Championship. On the June 24 episode of Raw, it was announced that Lesnar would face off against the WWE Undisputed Champion at SummerSlam, as a result of winning the King of the Ring tournament. At Vengeance, The Rock defeated The Undertaker and Kurt Angle in a triple threat match to win the WWE Undisputed Championship by pinning Angle after executing a Rock Bottom. On the July 25 episode of SmackDown!, during The Rock's WWE Tag Team Championship match against The Un-Americans (Lance Storm and Christian), Lesnar interfered by nailing The Rock's tag team partner Hollywood Hulk Hogan with an F-5. Due to Lesnar's interference, The Rock and Hogan won the match by disqualification, but not the titles. On the August 8 episode of SmackDown!, Lesnar put his SummerSlam title shot on the line against Hogan with the stipulation added that if Hogan were to defeat Lesnar, he would face The Rock in a WrestleMania X8 rematch at SummerSlam for the WWE Undisputed Championship. At the end, Lesnar locked Hogan in a bear hug. When Hogan (kayfabe) passed out, the referee stopped the contest. After the match, Lesnar then nailed Hogan in the head with the steel chair, causing Hogan to bleed. On the August 15 episode of SmackDown!, The Rock took on the WWE Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit in a \"Champion vs. Champion\" match, which Lesnar interfered once again. During the match, Lesnar taunted The Rock while The Rock was placed in the Crippler Crossface by Benoit. The Rock, however, was able to defeat Benoit following a Rock Bottom. On the August 22 episode of SmackDown!, after The Rock and Edge defeated Benoit and Eddie Guerrero in a tag team match, Lesnar appeared for another stare down with The Rock, which led to a brawl between the two that ended the show. On the July 25 episode of SmackDown!, Rey Mysterio made his WWE debut by defeating Chavo Guerrero. On the August 8 episode of SmackDown!, the team of Mysterio, Edge and John Cena defeated Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle when Mysterio pinned Angle. On the August 15 episode of SmackDown!, Angle insulted Mysterio during a backstage interview and Mysterio confronted him and challenged him to a match at SummerSlam, which Angle accepted. Later that night, Mysterio attacked Angle after his match against Mark Henry and delivered a 619 to Angle. On the August 22 episode of SmackDown!, Mysterio cost Angle a match against Billy Kidman by attacking Angle. Raw Another feud heading into SummerSlam was between Shawn Michaels and Triple H. At Vengeance, Michaels returned after being out of wrestling (due to a back injury) for four years. Triple H was given the choice of deciding which brand he would appear for, Raw or SmackDown!, and Michaels helped him decide by offering to reform D-Generation X (D-X) on the Raw brand. Triple H chose to go to the Raw brand, but on the July 22 episode of Raw, as Michaels and Triple H were in the middle of reforming D-X, Triple H turned on Michaels by nailing him with the Pedigree. On the July 29 episode of Raw, Michaels was found in the parking lot, laying motionless following an ambush. He was also bleeding from the head due to someone putting his head through a car window. On the August 5 episode of Raw, a security camera revealed to be Triple H that had attacked Michaels from behind. Triple H told Michaels that he did it to prove a point that Michaels was \"weak\". Michaels then told Triple H that he wasn't 100%, but he would be at SummerSlam. On the August 19 episode of Raw, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff announced an Unsanctioned Street Fight between Triple H and Michaels for SummerSlam. Later that night, Michaels interfered in Triple H's non-title match with The Rock and assaulted Triple H. At the beginning of the show, Brock Lesnar bought a front-row seat ticket to watch the main event between The Rock and Triple H, but even when Lesnar tried to interfere on Triple H's behalf, Michaels delivered a Sweet Chin Music to Lesnar. Michaels then leaped on top of Triple H and the security and ended the show by knocking Triple H down, sending a clear message that he was not weak as they headed into their match at SummerSlam. Rob Van Dam and Chris Benoit, meanwhile, had been feuding over the WWE Intercontinental Championship since Benoit won it from Van Dam on the July 29 episode of Raw. Shortly after this match, Benoit took advantage of what was referred to as \"open season\" on wrestler contracts and took his title with him to the SmackDown! brand, where he had originally been drafted. Benoit was still required to defend the title against a member of the Raw roster at SummerSlam and Van Dam defeated Jeff Hardy on the August 12 episode of Raw in a match to determine the #1 contender. Event The event unofficially began with a Sunday Night Heat match between Spike Dudley and Steven Richards. Dudley pinned Richards. Preliminary matches The first match was between Kurt Angle and Rey Mysterio. The match started off with Mysterio getting the advantage over Angle, as he hid under the ring, and when Mysterio's music hit, he took down Angle with a headscissors. The two entered the ring, which saw Mysterio execute a headscissors takeover. Mysterio attempted the 619 but Angle ducked and dominated Mysterio. However, Mysterio was able to execute a senton from the ring to the floor on Angle. Mysterio then delivered the 619 and the West Coast Pop for a nearfall. Angle reversed a diving hurricarana into the ankle lock, to which Mysterio submitted. The next match was a contest between Ric Flair and Chris Jericho. Jericho put Flair into the figure-four leglock. Jericho insisted that Flair submitted, but the referee ordered the match to continue. Flair then won the match by applying the hold on Jericho. The third match of the night was between Edge and Eddie Guerrero. During the match, Guerrero targeted Edge's shoulder. Guerrero also countered a spear attempt with a dropkick to the shoulder, and executed a frog splash onto Edge's shoulder. Edge retaliated with an Edgecution and a spear for the win. The next match was for the WWE Tag Team Championship between The Un-Americans (Lance Storm and Christian) and Booker T and Goldust. During the match, Booker T executed a scissors kick to both Storm and Christian, but Test made a run-in and gave Booker T a big boot. Christian pinned Booker T to retain the titles for The Un-Americans. The fifth match on the card was for the Intercontinental Championship between Chris Benoit and Rob Van Dam. Van Dam won the title by pinning Benoit after a Five Star Frog Splash. The Undertaker against Test was next. Lance Storm and Christian both interfered in the match, but received a chokeslam from The Undertaker. The Undertaker won the match with a Tombstone Piledriver. After the match, The Undertaker waved an American flag. The seventh match was the Unsanctioned Street Fight between Shawn Michaels and Triple H. This was Shawn Michaels' first wrestling match since WrestleMania XIV. Michaels came out fast, using a punch-kick offense to start and executing a plancha. Triple H executed a series of backbreakers on Michaels. Michaels hit Triple H with a ladder. Michaels executed a splash on Triple H from the top rope through a table on the floor and a diving elbow drop off a ladder. The match came to an end when Michaels went for the Sweet Chin Music, which Triple H countered into a Pedigree attempt, but Michaels countered into a jackknife roll-up for the win. After the match, Triple H hit Michaels with a sledgehammer twice, forcing Michaels to be carried away on a stretcher. Main event match The main event was for the WWE Undisputed Championship between The Rock and Brock Lesnar. Lesnar dominated early with some power moves. The Rock went for the Sharpshooter. Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman got involved in the match, as he was attacked by The Rock, who executed a Rock Bottom through a broadcast table on Heyman. The Rock and Brock Lesnar gave each other a Rock Bottom. The match came to an end when Lesnar stopped a People's Elbow and a Rock Bottom and then executed the F-5 on The Rock for the win and the title. Lesnar remained the youngest world champion in WWE history until Randy Orton won the World Heavyweight Championship in 2004. Aftermath On the August 26 episode of Raw, due to the requirements of the WWE Undisputed Championship being defended on both shows, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff expected Brock Lesnar to be able to return on Raw the next night. Lesnar and SmackDown! General Manager Stephanie McMahon appeared to announce that Lesnar's contract only required him to defend the title on SmackDown!; subsequently Bischoff established the World Heavyweight Championship as a separate world title. On the September 2 episode of Raw, Bischoff awarded Triple H, Raw'''s designated number-one contender, the World Heavyweight Championship in the form of the Big Gold Belt. The Undertaker went on to challenge Lesnar for the now-renamed WWE Championship at Unforgiven, and again at No Mercy in a Hell in a Cell match. Shawn Michaels would return full-time to the ring at Survivor Series and win the World Heavyweight Championship from Triple H in the first ever Elimination Chamber match. After the broadcasting of the event had stopped after the main event, former WWE Undisputed Champion The Rock was visibly angry at the crowd reaction. The Rock had faced a negative response from fans during the main event. When he tried to do a post-show speech for the crowd, the fans attending the Nassau Coliseum still booed him. He eventually cut a promo, declaring that \"sing-along with The Rock is over!\"'', before taking a six-month hiatus from WWE. The Rock did not return until late January 2003, where he turned heel on Hulk Hogan, leading to a WrestleMania X8 rematch at No Way Out where special guest referee Sylvain Grenier and Mr. McMahon both interfered and helped The Rock defeat Hogan.

{"text": "The 2003 SummerSlam was the 16th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place August 24, 2003, at the America West Arena in Phoenix, Arizona. Seven professional wrestling matches were set on the event's supercard, a scheduling of multiple high-level matches. The first main event was an Elimination Chamber match, in which World Heavyweight Champion Triple H defeated Chris Jericho, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels to retain his championship. In the other main event, defending WWE Champion Kurt Angle defeated Brock Lesnar in a standard wrestling match. The undercard included Kane defeating Rob Van Dam in a No Holds Barred match, and Eddie Guerrero defending his United States Championship against Chris Benoit, Rhyno, and Tajiri. There was also a match that occurred on the Sunday Night Heat pre-show. The event marked the second time the Elimination Chamber format was used by WWE; the first was at Survivor Series 2002. SummerSlam (2003) grossed over $715,000 ticket sales from an attendance of 16,113 and received about 415,000 pay-per-view buys, more than the following year's event. This event helped WWE increase its pay-per-view revenue by $6.2 million from the previous year. The event was also the final SummerSlam to not feature John Cena until the 2018 event. Production Background SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2003 event was the 16th SummerSlam and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands. It was scheduled to be held on August 24, 2003, at the America West Arena in Phoenix, Arizona. It was the first SummerSlam to feature the World Heavyweight Championship, following its establishment for Raw in September 2002 after the WWE Undisputed Championship became exclusive to SmackDown! and renamed to the WWE Championship. Storylines The professional wrestling matches at SummerSlam featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Storylines between the characters were produced on WWE's weekly television shows Raw and SmackDown! with the Raw and SmackDown! brands—storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its independent contractors to different programs. In the first main event of SummerSlam, wrestlers from the Raw brand competed in an Elimination Chamber match. The match was contested for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H defended the title against Chris Jericho, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels. The buildup to the match began on July 22, when during the SummerSlam press conference, the Raw co-general manager Eric Bischoff, announced that Triple H would defend the World Heavyweight Championship against Goldberg in a singles match at SummerSlam. On the August 4 episode of Raw, Bischoff changed the stipulations of the match to No disqualification regulations. Later during the episode, co-general manager Stone Cold Steve Austin altered Bischoff's announcement, stating that the World Heavyweight Championship would be contested in an Elimination Chamber match, with Triple H defending his title against Goldberg, Jericho, Nash, Orton, and Michaels. On the August 18 episode of Raw, the rivalry among the six competitors intensified during a promo, in which each participant in the Elimination Chamber discussed the match and taunted the other wrestlers. During the show's main event, in which Orton wrestled Goldberg, Nash interfered in the match and attacked Goldberg. Michaels then came down to the ring, but as he was about to hit Triple H with the World Heavyweight Championship belt, Jericho ran into the ring and hit Michaels with a chair. The second main event resulted from events on the SmackDown! brand. In the match, Kurt Angle defended his WWE Championship against Brock Lesnar. The build-up to the match began on the July 31 episode of SmackDown!. During an interview promotion in the ring, Lesnar challenged Angle to a rematch after Angle won the WWE Championship from him at Vengeance in a triple threat match (also involving Big Show). Vince McMahon decided that Lesnar would have to earn his rematch by competing in a steel cage match against McMahon himself with Angle officiating as a special guest referee. On the August 7 episode of SmackDown!, the steel cage match resulted in neither wrestler winning the match, after Lesnar attacked Angle and formed an alliance with McMahon. On the August 14 episode of SmackDown!, McMahon announced that Angle would defend the WWE Championship against Lesnar at SummerSlam. In a preliminary match involving wrestlers from the Raw brand, Rob Van Dam wrestled Kane under No disqualification regulations. The events leading up to this match began on the June 23 episode of Raw, when Kane took his mask off and exposed his face in front of Van Dam and the crowd after he lost to Triple H in a match for the World Heavyweight Championship (which was the stipulation) before chokeslamming Van Dam. On the July 7 episode of Raw, Kane attacked Van Dam backstage. On the July 14 episode of Raw, Eric Bischoff granted Van Dam a standard match against Kane, which took place on the July 21 episode of Raw and ended in neither wrestler winning the match. On the August 4 episode of Raw, Shane McMahon scheduled a No Disqualification match between Kane and Van Dam for SummerSlam. In another preliminary match, wrestlers from the SmackDown! brand competed in a fatal four-way match for the WWE United States Championship: Eddie Guerrero defended the title against Chris Benoit, Rhyno, and Tajiri. The buildup to the match began with two different rivalries, one between Guerrero and Tajiri, and the other between Benoit and Rhyno. On the August 7 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero and Benoit wrestled in a standard match. However, during the match, Rhyno and Tajiri interfered, resulting in neither wrestler winning the match. Sgt. Slaughter, a WWE official, scheduled a tag team match between Guerrero and Rhyno and Benoit and Tajiri, which Benoit and Tajiri won. On the August 14 episode of SmackDown!, it was announced that Guerrero would defend the WWE United States Championship against Benoit, Rhyno, and Tajiri at SummerSlam. Event Sunday Night Heat Before the event aired live on pay-per-view, Matt Hardy faced Zach Gowen on Sunday Night Heat. Gowen, however, was unable to compete due to legitimate injuries he sustained at the hands of Brock Lesnar on the August 21, 2003 edition of SmackDown!. As a result, Hardy was declared the winner via forfeit. In the next match, Rey Mysterio faced Shannon Moore for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship, in which Mysterio pinned Moore to retain the title after he performed 619. Preliminary matches After Sunday Night Heat, the pay-per-view event began with a tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship. The champions, La Résistance (René Duprée and Sylvain Grenier), defended their titles against The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley). Throughout the match, both teams performed many offensive maneuvers, though The Dudley Boyz were able to gain the upper hand when they executed a 3D on Duprée. As D-Von covered Duprée, Rob Conway, who was disguised as a cameraman, hit D-Von with a camera while the referee was distracted. Duprée then covered D-Von for a successful pinfall to retain the championship. The following match pitted The Undertaker against A-Train in a standard match. In the early stages both competitors wrestled inconclusively before The Undertaker gained the advantage. He attempted to lift A-Train for a Tombstone piledriver. A-Train countered it, in the process knocking the referee down. He attempted to take advantage of the situation by trying to hit The Undertaker with a steel chair. The Undertaker, however, countered the attack with his boot, causing the chair to hit A-Train in the face. The Undertaker then chokeslammed A-Train and, since the referee had recuperated, covered his opponent for the pinfall. After the match, Sable tried to seduce Undertaker, but was grabbed by the throat and then was attacked by a returning Stephanie McMahon. The third match Shane McMahon against Eric Bischoff. McMahon and Bischoff began by brawling on the arena ramp, as Jonathan Coachman appeared from the backstage area and hit McMahon with a steel chair. Bischoff grabbed a microphone and announced that the match would be contested under no disqualification, falls count anywhere regulations. Coachman and Bischoff performed double-team attacks on McMahon until Stone Cold Steve Austin interfered by performing a Stone Cold Stunner on Coachman and Bischoff. After Austin's interference, McMahon positioned Bischoff on the television commentators' table, performed a Leap of Faith onto Bischoff's chest, thereby breaking the table and covered Bischoff for the pinfall. The next match was a Fatal 4-Way match for the WWE United States Championship; Eddie Guerrero defended the title against Chris Benoit, Rhyno, and Tajiri. The match began with Guerrero wrestling with Tajiri, while Benoit wrestled with Rhyno. During the encounter Guerrero applied a Lasso From El Passo on Tajiri, while Benoit employed a Crippler Crossface on Rhyno. Afterwards, Tajiri applied a Tarantula on Benoit. The hold distracted the referee, which allowed Guerrero to hit Rhyno with the United States Championship belt. Tajiri then attempted to hit Benoit with a Buzzsaw Kick, but Benoit countered the maneuver by lifting and sitting Tajiri onto his shoulders. Tajiri, however, countered by tossing both himself and Benoit over the top rope onto the arena floor. Capitalizing on the situation, Guerrero then performed a Frog splash on Rhyno, after which he scored the pinfall, thus retaining the WWE United States Championship. Main event matches The fifth match was a match for the WWE Championship, in which Kurt Angle defended the title against Brock Lesnar. At the beginning of the match, Lesnar tried to walk away from the ring, but Angle brought him back. There, Angle performed many offensive maneuvers, including a DDT and the Angle Slam. He then applied an ankle lock on Lesnar. During this tussle, Lesnar countered the hold but knocked down the referee. Angle applied a guillotine choke on Lesnar, which brought Lesnar down onto his knees and allowed Angle to perform another ankle lock. Mr. McMahon interfered, came into the ring and hit Angle's back with a steel chair to break the submission hold. Because the referee was incapacitated, Lesnar was not disqualified for the interference. Afterwards, Lesnar twice attempted to lift Angle onto his F-5. During the second attempt, however, Angle countered the throw into another ankle lock, which forced Lesnar to tap out. As a result, Angle retained the WWE Championship. After the match, Angle slammed McMahon through a chair. In the sixth match, Kane faced Rob Van Dam in a No Holds Barred match. Both wrestlers used the steel folding ladder to their advantage early in the match. After Kane used the ladder on Van Dam, he attempted to hit Van Dam with a flying clothesline. However, Van Dam moved out of the way and Kane landed on the arena barricade. Van Dam performed a variation of a rolling thunder on Kane using a steel folding chair. Following this, Van Dam attempted to hit Kane with a Van Daminator with the steel chair, but Kane rolled out of the ring to avoid the attack. Van Dam then attempted an aerial technique from inside the ring towards Kane, but Kane caught Van Dam in mid-air and executed an Tombstone Piledriver on the steel ring steps, after which he covered Van Dam for the pinfall to win the match. The main event was the Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H defended the title against Chris Jericho, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels. The match began with Jericho and Michaels in the ring, while Goldberg, Nash, Orton, and Triple H were locked in the chambers. Michaels and Jericho wrestled, with neither of them gaining the advantage over the other. Orton and Nash were the third and fourth entrants into the match, respectively. Nash was the first wrestler eliminated from the match after Michaels executed a Sweet Chin Music and Jericho covered him for a pinfall. Triple H and Goldberg were the fifth and sixth entrants. Michaels performed another Sweet Chin Music on Triple H as soon as he exited his chamber, and as a result, Triple H was knocked back into his chamber. As soon as Goldberg entered the match, he performed a spear for a pinfall to eliminate Orton. Next, Goldberg performed a Jackhammer on both Michaels and Jericho, at one point spearing Jericho through a chamber pod, eliminating both via pinfall. This left Goldberg alone with and Triple H, who at the time had remained inside the chamber. Goldberg broke through the glass of his chamber, in the process dragging him out of the chamber. Ric Flair, who was managing both Triple H and Orton, then handed Triple H a sledgehammer. Goldberg attempted another spear on Triple H, who countered the maneuver by hitting Goldberg in the head with the sledgehammer and covered him for the pinfall, thus retaining the World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Triple H, Orton and Flair launched a vicious 3-on-1 beatdown on Goldberg, ending with Triple H busting Goldberg open by repeatedly hitting him with his sledgehammer before yelling \"this is as close as you will ever get to my title!\" whilst holding the World Heavyweight Championship up to Goldberg's face. Reception The America West Arena has a maximum capacity of 19,000, but that was reduced for SummerSlam 2003. The event grossed over US$715,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 16,113, the maximum allowed. This was later confirmed by Linda McMahon, WWE CEO, in a press release on August 26, 2003. The event resulted in 415,000 pay-per-view buys (a 0.88 pay-per-view buyrate). The promotion's pay-per-view revenue was $24.7 million. Canadian Online Explorer's professional wrestling section rated the entire event a 7 out of 10 stars. The rating was higher than the SummerSlam event in 2004, which was rated a 5 out of 10 stars. The Elimination Chamber main event match from the Raw brand was rated an 9.6 out of 10 stars. The SmackDown! brand's main event, a standard match for the WWE Championship, was rated a 9 out of 10 stars, a lower reception than the Raw brand's main event. Wade Keller reviewed the event for the Pro Wrestling Torch. He rated the Angle-Lesnar match 4-and-a-half out of 5 stars, declaring it an \"excellent match\". The Elimination Chamber match received a rating of 3 stars. The event was released on DVD on September 23, 2003 by Sony Music Entertainment. Aftermath During an episode of Raw after SummerSlam, Goldberg challenged Triple H to another match for the World Heavyweight Championship. This match took place at the Unforgiven pay-per-view on September 21, 2003, with a stipulation that, should he lose, Goldberg would retire from WWE. Goldberg defeated Triple H to become the new champion. After SummerSlam, Kurt Angle focused his attention on The Undertaker, whom he wrestled in a match for the WWE Championship during an episode of SmackDown! on September 4, 2003. During the match, Lesnar attacked both wrestlers with a folding chair, leading to an Iron Man match between Angle and Lesnar. Lesnar won five falls during the match, while Angle won four, and as a result Lesnar won the title. The rivalry between Kane and Rob Van Dam was stopped, as Kane engaged in a feud against Shane McMahon. In a scenario on the August 25, 2003 episode of Raw, Kane attempted to throw McMahon into a dumpster that was set on fire, but McMahon avoided it and threw Kane into the dumpster. On September 8, 2003, during an episode of Raw, Eric Bischoff scheduled a Last Man Standing match between Kane and McMahon for Unforgiven. In that match, Kane defeated McMahon after McMahon was unable to respond to a ten count. After SummerSlam, Eddie Guerrero began a rivalry with John Cena over the WWE United States Championship. Guerrero retained the championship in two title defenses that took place on SmackDown!. Guerrero then engaged in a feud with Big Show. At No Mercy, Big Show defeated Guerrero via pinfall to win the WWE United States Championship.

{"text": "The 2004 SummerSlam was the 17th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place on August 15, 2004, at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Nine matches were contested at the event, including one on the Sunday Night Heat pre-show. The main match on the Raw brand was Chris Benoit versus Randy Orton for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Orton won by pinfall after performing an RKO. The predominant match on the SmackDown! brand was John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) versus The Undertaker for the WWE Championship, which JBL won after Undertaker was disqualified. The featured matches on the undercard included Kurt Angle versus Eddie Guerrero and Triple H versus Eugene. Production Background SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2004 event was the 17th SummerSlam and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands. It was scheduled to be held on August 15, 2004, at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Storylines The main feud heading into SummerSlam on the Raw brand was between Chris Benoit and Randy Orton, with the two feuding over the World Heavyweight Championship. At Vengeance, Benoit defeated Triple H to retain the title. On the July 26 episode of Raw, Orton won a 20-man battle royal, last eliminating Chris Jericho, to become the number one contender to the title at SummerSlam. Also that night, Benoit defeated Triple H in a 60-minute Iron Man match to retain the title with the help of Eugene. On the August 2 episode of Raw, Evolution (Orton, Batista, and Ric Flair) defeated Benoit, Edge, and Jericho in a six man tag team match when Orton pinned Benoit following an RKO. On the August 9 episode of Raw, Benoit defeated Orton and Triple H in a Handicap match by disqualification. The primary feud on the SmackDown! brand was between John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) and The Undertaker, over the WWE Championship. JBL had won the title two months prior at The Great American Bash by defeating then-champion Eddie Guerrero in a Texas Bullrope match. On the July 22 episode of SmackDown!, JBL defeated a jobber to retain the title. After the match, Undertaker came out and challenged JBL to a match at SummerSlam. On the August 5 episode of SmackDown!, as JBL called out Undertaker, a midget wrestler came out and began to imitate the real Undertaker. The real Undertaker came out shortly afterwards and attacked JBL, until Orlando Jordan came out to help him. On the August 12 episode of SmackDown!, Undertaker defeated Jordan by disqualification after JBL interfered and executed a Clothesline from Hell on Undertaker. The secondary feud on the SmackDown! brand was between Kurt Angle and Eddie Guerrero. The feud first started at WrestleMania XX, when Guerrero defeated Angle to successfully retain the WWE Championship. Guerrero lost the title to John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) at The Great American Bash, when Angle, then-SmackDown! General Manager, screwed Guerrero and declared JBL the winner. On the July 15 episode of SmackDown!, JBL defeated Guerrero in a Steel Cage match to retain the title. Towards the end of the match, El Gran Luchadore (portrayed by Angle) interfered, giving JBL enough time to escape the cage and win the match. After the match ended, Guerrero attacked El Gran Luchadore and pulled off his mask, revealing him to be Angle. On the July 22 episode of SmackDown!, Vince McMahon fired Angle as SmackDown! General Manager and scheduled a match between Angle and Guerrero for SummerSlam. The secondary feud on the Raw brand was between Triple H and Eugene. The feud first started on the May 17 episode of Raw, during an in-ring segment with The Rock, Eugene revealed that his favorite wrestler was in fact Triple H due to Eugene's adoration of \"playing games\". Capitalizing on this opportunity, Triple H began to befriend the star-struck and naive Eugene even making the young wrestler an honorary member of Triple H's stable Evolution. However, Triple H soon revealed that this was all a calculated ploy and that he planned to utilize Eugene to help him win back the World Heavyweight Championship from Chris Benoit. Yet, Triple H's plan failed miserably when during his title match with Benoit at Vengeance, Eugene inadvertently hit him with a steel chair costing him the match and the championship. On the July 12 episode of Raw, Triple H attacked Eugene in the ring after falsely implying that he had forgiven him for what happened at Vengeance. On the July 26 episode of Raw, Eugene would return to exact a degree of revenge by costing Triple H his re-match with Benoit. On the August 2 episode of Raw, Triple H demanded a match between the two at SummerSlam, to which Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff agreed. Event Preliminary matches Before the event went live on pay-per-view, Rob Van Dam defeated René Duprée in a match taped for Sunday Night Heat. The first match was a six-man tag team match between The Dudleys (Bubba Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley, and Spike Dudley) and the team of Rey Mysterio, Billy Kidman, and Paul London. Spike pinned Kidman after a 3D from Bubba Ray and D-Von to win the match for his team. The next match was between Kane and Matt Hardy in a \"Till Death To Us Part\" match. Hardy gained control over Kane after performing a Twist of Fate on Kane outside of the ring and attacking him with the ring bell. Kane then countered a suplex attempt by Hardy into a chokeslam from the top rope to win the match. As a result of the pre-match stipulation, Lita was forced to marry Kane, as part of their on-going storyline. The third match was between John Cena and Booker T in the first match of a \"Best of 5 series\" for the WWE United States Championship. Early in the match, Cena gained the advantage over Booker. In the end, Booker performed a scissors kick on Cena, who retaliated by performing an FU to win the match and go up 1-0 in the series. The following match was a Triple Threat match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship involving Edge, Batista and Chris Jericho. During the match, Edge and Jericho performed double-team maneuvers onto Batista. Edge performed a spear on Jericho to retain the title. The fifth match was between Kurt Angle and Eddie Guerrero. Angle gained control over Guerrero early on in the match. Mid-match, the referee was knocked out, and as a result, Guerrero took his boot off and used it to hit both Angle and Luther Reigns, who was at ringside with Angle and tried to get involved in the match. The match concluded when Angle was able to counter a frog splash and forced Guerrero to submit to the Ankle Lock. The next match was between Triple H and Eugene. At the start of the match, Triple H pretended to attack the ring announcer, Lilian Garcia, as a distraction to attack Eugene. Eugene countered Triple H's attacks by executing a Rock Bottom. During the match, Ric Flair attempted to interfere but he was ejected by the referee. As Flair was leaving from ringside, William Regal hit Flair with a pair of brass knuckles. Triple H performed a Pedigree on Eugene to win the match. Main event matches The following match was for the WWE Championship between John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) and The Undertaker. Immediately, JBL and Undertaker started the match outside of the ring. Mid-match, the referee was knocked out. Orlando Jordan passed JBL the title belt, which JBL used to hit Undertaker with. Undertaker was disqualified after the referee saw him hit JBL with the title belt, meaning JBL retained the title. Undertaker executed a chokeslam to JBL through the roof of JBL's limousine, leading to JBL being taken out of the arena on a stretcher. The main event was between Chris Benoit and Randy Orton for the World Heavyweight Championship. Orton attempted to apply a Sharpshooter on Benoit but Benoit applied a Sharpshooter on Orton. Later in the match, Benoit performed seven German suplexes on Orton but Orton blocked a diving headbutt. In the end, Benoit attempted to apply the Crippler Crossface but Orton countered into an RKO to win the title. Following the match whilst Orton was celebrating his victory, Benoit returned to the ring and offered Orton a handshake, telling him to \"be a man\", which Orton accepted. Aftermath On the August 16 episode of Raw, Randy Orton defeated Chris Benoit in a rematch to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Evolution (Batista, Ric Flair, and Triple H), threw Orton a mock celebration, only to reveal that they were not pleased with his new victory. While Batista had Orton propped on his shoulders, Triple H gave him a pleased thumbs up, but abruptly changed it to a thumbs-down. He then told Batista to drop Orton to the mat, and Flair and Batista attacked Orton as Triple H told him that he was nothing without Evolution, and decided that Orton was on his own. On the August 23 episode of Raw, Triple H told Orton to give him the title or \"pay the price\". Orton refused, and then he spat in Triple H's face and hit him with the title belt turning Orton into a face. Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff then scheduled a match between Orton and Triple H for the title at Unforgiven. At Unforgiven, Orton lost the title when he was pinned by Triple H. The feud between John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) and The Undertaker continued. The next few weeks on SmackDown!, JBL wore a neck brace, to signify that he was recuperating from Undertaker's chokeslam. On the August 26 episode of SmackDown!, Orlando Jordan defended the WWE Championship for JBL against The Undertaker. Undertaker won the match via disqualification following interference from JBL; as a result, JBL retained the title. The following week on SmackDown!, General Manager Theodore Long scheduled a Last Ride match at No Mercy between JBL and Undertaker. At No Mercy, JBL retained the title after interference by Heidenreich.

{"text": "The 2005 SummerSlam was the 18th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place on August 21, 2005, at the MCI Center in Washington, D.C. Nine matches were contested at the event, including one on the Sunday Night Heat pre-show. The main match on the Raw brand was Hulk Hogan versus Shawn Michaels, which Hogan won by pinfall after executing a leg drop. The predominant match on the SmackDown brand was a No Holds Barred match for the World Heavyweight Championship between Batista and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL), which Batista won by pinfall after executing two Batista Bombs, with the second on the steel ring steps. Another primary match on the Raw brand was for the WWE Championship between John Cena and Chris Jericho, which Cena won by pinfall after performing an FU. The main match on the undercard featured a ladder match for the custody of Rey Mysterio's son Dominik between Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero, which Mysterio won by retrieving the briefcase suspended above the ring. Production Background SummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2005 event was the 18th event in the SummerSlam chronology and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands. It was scheduled to be held on August 21, 2005, at the MCI Center in Washington, D.C. WWE had originally planned a match between Muhammad Hassan and Batista for SmackDown!'s World Heavyweight Championship, which would have made Hassan the youngest world champion in WWE history at 23, breaking Randy Orton's record. The storyline was scheduled to begin at The Great American Bash in which he faced The Undertaker in a number one contenders match for the World Heavyweight Championship, but it was scrapped in the aftermath of the London bombings that occurred three days after SmackDown! was taped. Storylines Eight professional wrestling matches were scheduled on the event's card, which were planned with predetermined outcomes by WWE's script writers. The storylines revolving around these matches before, during, and after the event were also planned by the script writers. The event featured wrestlers and other talent from both the Raw and SmackDown! brands – a storyline expansion to which WWE assigned its employees. Wrestlers portrayed either a hero or villain gimmick, as they followed a series of events which generally built tension, leading to a wrestling match. The main feud heading into SummerSlam on the Raw brand was between Hulk Hogan and Shawn Michaels. A feud between Michaels, and Muhammad Hassan and Daivari began on the April 4 episode of Raw, when Hassan and Daivari attacked Michaels. Michaels demanded a match against the two, but he would only be given one if he found a partner. Hogan eventually became Michaels' partner, and they defeated Hassan and Daivari at Backlash. Hogan did not appear again until the July 4 episode of Raw in Carlito's talk show segment Carlito's Cabana. Carlito, along with Kurt Angle, made comments about Hogan's daughter Brooke and eventually attacked him. Michaels came out to help Hogan, and they defeated Carlito and Angle in a match later that night. The match saw Hogan and Michaels get the victory. During the post-match pose, Michaels superkicked Hogan, which knocked Hogan to the ground and turning Michaels heel for the first time since returning to the company in 2002. The following week, Michaels challenged Hogan to a match at SummerSlam, which Hogan accepted. The predominant feud on the SmackDown! brand was between Batista and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL), with the two feuding over the World Heavyweight Championship. During the WWE Draft Lottery, SmackDown! was left temporarily without a top championship after John Cena, the reigning WWE Champion, was drafted to Raw. On the June 30 edition of SmackDown!, a six-man elimination match between JBL, The Undertaker, Booker T, and SmackDown! draftees Chris Benoit, Christian, and Muhammad Hassan was made and General Manager Theodore Long was to present a new title to the winner called the SmackDown! Championship. JBL won the match by eliminating Christian last, but Long announced that plans had changed and there was no need for a SmackDown! Championship. Instead, Long revealed that Batista, who had been the reigning World Heavyweight Champion since defeating Triple H at WrestleMania 21, was joining the brand as the final draft pick and by winning the match, JBL was the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. JBL faced Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship at The Great American Bash, where JBL won by disqualification when Batista used a steel chair. JBL was given a rematch at SummerSlam on the following episode of SmackDown! after defeating The Undertaker. Batista allowed JBL to choose the stipulation, and JBL made it a No Holds Barred match. On the August 11 episode of SmackDown!, during Batista's match with Christian, JBL interfered and hit Batista with a steel chair. The following week, JBL faced Funaki in a No Holds Barred match, during which Batista interfered and attacked JBL. Another rivalry leading into the event was between John Cena and Chris Jericho, with the two battling over the WWE Championship. Their feud began when Cena was drafted to Raw during the draft lottery and began a feud with Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff. Cena refused to comply with Bischoff, who saw Cena as an unfit champion. After Cena successfully defended the WWE Championship in a triple threat match at Vengeance against Jericho and Christian, Bischoff hand-picked Jericho to face Cena for the WWE Championship at SummerSlam. On the August 1 episode of Raw, Jericho refereed a WWE Championship match between Cena and Carlito (which Cena won). After the match, Jericho attacked Cena with a television camera. On the August 15 episode of Raw, Cena defeated Jericho and Carlito in a handicap match. At the end, Jericho hit Cena with a steel chair. Event Preliminary matches Before the event officially began, Chris Masters defeated The Hurricane in a match taped for Sunday Night Heat. In the first match, Orlando Jordan faced Chris Benoit for the United States Championship. The match started with both locked up in a collar-and-elbow. Benoit forced Jordan into the corner, and as the referee was trying to break them up, Jordan punched Benoit. Benoit then avoided a clothesline and performed a German suplex. Benoit applied the Crippler Crossface to force Jordan to submit to win the match and the title in 25.5 seconds. In the second match, Edge faced Matt Hardy. Fueled by a storyline stemming from previous real-life tensions between the two former friends over Hardy's real-life girlfriend Lita having an affair with Edge, the fight started outside the ring, with Hardy gaining the early advantage. After repeated punches, Hardy applied a rear naked choke. Edge fought back with a headbutt and punches. Edge then performed a spear to the outside. Both were down briefly before Edge brought Hardy back into the ring. Hardy fought back with punches and mounted punches in the corner. During this, Edge pushed Hardy upwards, causing his head to hit the ringpost and bleed. Edge attacked Hardy's head repeatedly, and Hardy was incapable of defending himself. The referee finally stopped the match and awarded Edge the victory. This match, seen by many as a disappointment, was highly anticipated due to the WWE's storyline exploiting real life events between Edge and Hardy. The third match was a Ladder match between Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio for the custody of Dominik. A briefcase with legal documents inside was suspended above the ring. After throwing Mysterio into the steel steps, Guerrero ascended a ladder. Mysterio performed a springboard dropkick to knock down the ladder. Mysterio then performed a dropkick, sending the ladder into Guerrero's face, and a springboard seated senton to the outside. Guerrero then performed a powerbomb off the ladder, and a Hilo to Mysterio, who was sandwiched between two ladders. Both ascended the ladder again, and Mysterio performed a back body drop onto another ladder. Guerrero performed an Alley Oop to Mysterio onto a ladder balanced on the top rope. As Guerrero ascended the ladder, Dominick entered the ring and attempted to shake the ladder. Guerrero confronted him and, as he was about to attack him, Mysterio fought off Guerrero and performed a 619 and a Droppin' Da Dime with the ladder. Both attempted to obtain the briefcase, but was stopped by the other. After Guerrero performed the Three Amigos onto a ladder, he ascended the ladder, but Vickie Guerrero came down and pushed down the ladder. She then held onto Eddie as Mysterio retrieved the briefcase to win the match. The fourth match was between Eugene and Kurt Angle for the Olympic gold medal that originally belonged to Angle. Angle gained the early advantage with repeated short-arm clotheslines. Eugene then countered with a spinebuster and attempted a People's Elbow, but Angle performed a clothesline. Angle then performed several German suplexes. Eugene fought back and performed a Rock Bottom. Eugene then performed a Stone Cold Stunner and applied the ankle lock. Angle countered and performed an Angle Slam. He then applied the ankle lock and forced Eugene to submit to win the match. After the match, Angle threw Eugene out of the ring and had the referee place the gold medal around his neck. The fifth match was between The Undertaker and Randy Orton. The Undertaker gained the advantage after a leaping flying clothesline and attacks in the corner. Orton gained the advantage by avoiding a big boot. Orton then attacked The Undertaker's left knee. The Undertaker eventually countered an attack by sending Orton outside the ring. The Undertaker then performed a guillotine leg drop to Orton, who was on the apron. The Undertaker then performed an Old School and a reverse STO. The Undertaker then performed a Snake Eyes, but Orton came back with a dropkick. The Undertaker avoided an RKO attempt and attempted a Tombstone Piledriver, which Orton countered into an inverted headlock backbreaker. Orton then performed a crossbody, but The Undertaker rolled through and performed a chokeslam. A fan then entered the ring and distracted The Undertaker, allowing Orton to perform an RKO and win the match. Orton then revealed the fan to be \"Cowboy\" Bob Orton in disguise. Main event matches In the sixth match, John Cena faced Chris Jericho for the WWE Championship. Jericho gained the early advantage until missing a springboard crossbody to the outside. Cena fought back briefly, but Jericho fought back, dropkicking and superplexing Cena. Cena fought back with a back body drop, but missed a leaping shoulder block. Jericho then delivered a one-handed bulldog, but missed a lionsault. Jericho countered an FU attempt and attempted to apply the Walls of Jericho, but Cena kicked Jericho outside. Cena performed a diving leg drop bulldog and attempted an FU, but Jericho countered into a DDT. Jericho then performed a pendulum backbreaker and repeated elbow drops to Cena's back. Cena fought back and performed a spin-out powerbomb. He then attempted a Five Knuckle Shuffle, but Jericho countered and applied the Walls of Jericho. He then performed a belly to back suplex from the top rope. As he attempted another attack, Cena countered into an FU to win the match and retain his title. The seventh match was a No Holds Barred match between John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) and Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship. JBL attacked Batista during his entrance, and they fought on the entrance ramp and at ringside, using several weapons. Batista performed a spear to JBL through the security wall. JBL shoved Batista into the ringpost and continued to beat down Batista after a short-arm clothesline. He then whipped and choked Batista with a leather belt. Batista fought back with a belly to back suplex and whipped JBL with the belt. JBL fought back, performing a Clothesline from Hell for a near-fall and bringing the steel steps into the ring. He attempted an attack on the steps, but Batista countered with a back body drop. He then performed a spinebuster and two Batista Bombs, with the second onto the steel steps, to win the match and retain his title. The main event was between Shawn Michaels and Hulk Hogan. This was Hogan's first SummerSlam appearance since 1991. During Hogan's entrance, a huge American flag unrolled from the top of the stage and covered the entire set. The match started slowly, until Hogan sent Michaels outside. Hogan performed a scoop slam on the announce table and sent Michaels into the ringpost. Michaels reversed another attempt and sent Hogan into the ringpost twice. Michaels continued to attack his head with punches and mounted punches and applied the sleeper hold. Hogan fought out of it with a belly to back suplex, but failed to gain the advantage as Michaels performed a flying forearm smash. Michaels then missed a diving elbow drop, and Hogan fought back briefly. Michaels performed another flying forearm smash and applied the sharpshooter. Hogan broke the hold and avoided another attempt by kicking Michaels into the referee. Michaels performed a low blow and hit Hogan with a steel chair. Michaels then performed a diving elbow drop and a superkick. Michaels attempted a pinfall but Hogan kicked out at a two count. Hogan then delivered a big boot and a leg drop to win the match. After the match, Michaels extended his hand to Hogan saying, \"I needed to know and I found out,\" and Hogan shook his hand. Aftermath The following night on Raw, Eric Bischoff made a You're Fired match between John Cena and Chris Jericho for the WWE Championship. Although Bischoff interfered, Cena won the match, and Jericho was fired. Immediately after the match, Kurt Angle attacked Cena and was revealed to be Bischoff's new hand-picked representative to win the title from Cena. Angle and Cena feuded until the start of 2006, with Angle unable to win the title, and Bischoff being fired. The feud between Batista and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) ended when Batista defeated JBL in a Texas Bullrope match on the September 9 episode of SmackDown!. Batista then began a storyline with Eddie Guerrero when Guerrero was given a title match at No Mercy, and the two became friends. This storyline ended prematurely due to Guerrero's unexpected death on November 13. The feud between Matt Hardy and Edge continued with a Street Fight on the August 29 episode of Raw (which ended in a no contest) and a Steel Cage match at Unforgiven (which Hardy won), and it ended with Hardy losing a Loser Leaves Raw Ladder match on the October 3 episode of Raw. The feud between The Undertaker and Randy Orton continued with a Handicap Casket match at No Mercy, where The Undertaker lost to Randy and \"Cowboy\" Bob Orton. After the match, Randy and Bob poured gasoline on the casket and set it ablaze. The Undertaker had vanished from the casket, and their feud briefly went on hiatus until Survivor Series. Shawn Michaels started a feud with Chris Masters when Masters interrupted Michaels, wanting to take the spotlight. The feud between Chris Benoit and Orlando Jordan continued with Jordan losing in rematches, lasting less than a minute each. In mid-2006, WWE launched a third brand dubbed ECW, which featured wrestlers from the former Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion, as well as newer talent. Additionally, the ECW World Heavyweight Championship was reactivated to be the brand's top championship, and third concurrently active world title in WWE.

{"text": "Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 516 U.S. 233 (1996), is a United States Supreme Court case that tested the extent of software copyright. The lower court had held that copyright does not extend to the user interface of a computer program, such as the text and layout of menus. Due to the recusal of one justice, the Supreme Court decided the case with an eight-member bench split evenly, leaving the lower court's decision affirmed but setting no national precedent. Background information Borland released a spreadsheet product, Quattro Pro, with a compatibility mode in which its menu imitated Lotus 1-2-3, a competing product. None of the source code or machine code that generated the menus was copied, but the names of the commands and the organization of those commands into a hierarchy were virtually identical. Quattro Pro also contained a \"Key Reader\" feature, which allowed it to execute Lotus 1-2-3 keyboard macros. To support this feature, Quattro Pro's code contained a copy of Lotus's menu hierarchy in which each command was represented by its first letter instead of its entire name. Borland CEO Philippe Kahn took the case to the software development community arguing that Lotus's position would stifle innovation and damage the future of software development. The vast majority of the software development community supported Borland's position. District Court case Lotus filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on July 2, 1990, claiming that the structure of the menus was copyrighted by Lotus. The district court ruled that Borland had infringed Lotus's copyright. The ruling was based in part on the fact that an alternative satisfactory menu structure could be designed. For example, the \"Quit\" command could be changed to \"Exit\". Borland immediately removed the Lotus-based menu system from Quattro Pro, but retained support for its \"Key Reader\" feature, and Lotus filed a supplemental claim against this feature. A district court held that this also constituted copyright infringement. Circuit Court case Borland appealed the decision of the district court arguing that the menu hierarchy is a \"method of operation\", which is not copyrightable according to 17 U.S.C. § 102(b). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed the district court's decision, agreeing with Borland's legal theory that considered the menu hierarchy a \"method of operation\". The court agreed with the district court that an alternative menu hierarchy could be devised, but argued that despite this, the menu hierarchy is an uncopyrightable \"method of operation\".We hold that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is an uncopyrightable “method of operation.” The Lotus menu command hierarchy provides the means by which users control and operate Lotus 1–2–3. If users wish to copy material, for example, they use the “Copy” command. If users wish to print material, they use the “Print” command. Users must use the command terms to tell the computer what to do. Without the menu command hierarchy, users would not be able to access and control, or indeed make use of, Lotus 1–2–3's functional capabilities.The court made an analogy between the menu hierarchy and the arrangement of buttons on a VCR. The buttons are used to control the playback of a video tape, just as the menu commands are used to control the operations of Lotus 1-2-3. Since the buttons are essential to operating the VCR, their layout cannot be copyrighted. Likewise, the menu commands, including the textual labels and the hierarchical layout, are essential to operating Lotus 1-2-3. The court also considered the impact of their decision on users of software. If menu hierarchies were copyrightable, users would be required to learn how to perform the same operation in a different way for every program, which the court finds \"absurd\". Additionally, all macros would have to be re-written for each different program, which places an undue burden on users. Concurring opinion Judge Michael Boudin wrote a concurring opinion for this case. In this opinion, he discusses the costs and benefits of copyright protection, as well as the potential similarity of software copyright protection to patent protection. He argues that software is different from creative works, which makes it difficult to apply copyright law to software. His opinion also considers the theory that Borland's use of the Lotus menu is \"privileged\". That is, because Borland copied the menu for a legitimate purpose of compatibility, its use should be allowed. This decision, if issued by the majority of the court, would have been narrower in scope than the \"method of operations\" decision. Copying a menu hierarchy would be allowed in some circumstances, and disallowed in others. Supreme Court case Lotus petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. In a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court affirmed the circuit court's judgment due to an evenly divided court, with Justice Stevens recusing. Because the Court split evenly, it affirmed the First Circuit's decision without discussion and did not establish any national precedent on the copyright issue. Lotus's petition for a rehearing by the full court was denied. By the time the lawsuit ended, Borland had sold Quattro Pro to Novell, and Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet had emerged as the main challenger to Lotus 1-2-3. Impact The Lotus decision establishes a distinction in copyright law between the interface of a software product and its implementation. The implementation is subject to copyright. The public interface may also be subject to copyright to the extent that it contains expression (for example, the appearance of an icon).

{"text": "General elections were held in Belize on 27 August 1998. The result was a victory for the People's United Party, which won 26 of the 29 seats and Said Musa was elected as Prime Minister for the first time. Voter turnout was 90%, the highest since independence. Background The ruling United Democratic Party (UDP) was widely perceived as incompetent, incapable of governing and riddled with corruption. Crime and unemployment rose while a number of government projects were universally panned. After winning nationwide municipal elections in 1994, they had lost two other municipal votes in 1996 and 1997. The PUP capitalized on the people's anger to present a manifesto of far-reaching proposals which they claimed would \"Set Belize Free\". Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel advised Governor General Sir Colville Young to dissolve the House of Representatives on 13 July 1998. The House stood dissolved with effect from 15 July 1998. Election day was set for 27 August 1998. Nomination day was 11 August 1998; five political parties nominated 79 candidates, with three independents contesting. The radio station LOVE FM held the first Prime Ministerial debate in Belize on 23 July 1998; it was attended by PM Esquivel and PUP leader Musa. Another debate would not be held until the 2020 election. One controversy as the election date drew near was Attorney General Dean Barrow's rushed appointment of Manuel Sosa to the position of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court on 19 August to replace the ailing George Singh, just days before the election. Then-opposition leader Said Musa objected to this last minute appointment, and after his party took power was able to have it overturned on the grounds that he had not been properly consulted on the appointment as required by the constitution. The National Alliance for Belizean Rights, which had run in coalition with the UDP in the previous election, chose to run on its own despite its sole member in the House, Philip Goldson, standing down. The party failed to win any seats and was not a factor in the election. Results The PUP won 26 of a possible 29 seats, the most lopsided general election win since independence. Several high-ranking UDP members went down to defeat, most notably Esquivel himself in Caribbean Shores. Only Barrow in Queen's Square and Michael Finnegan in Mesopotamia retained their seats for the UDP, while Erwin Contreras narrowly defeated the PUP's Amin Hegar in Cayo West for the UDP's third seat. Barrow became UDP leader shortly after the election. References Belize Belize Legislative election General elections in Belize"}

{"text": "The United States produces mainly biodiesel and ethanol fuel, which uses corn as the main feedstock. The US is the world's largest producer of ethanol, having produced nearly 16 billion gallons in 2017 alone. The United States, together with Brazil accounted for 85 percent of all ethanol production, with total world production of 27.05 billion gallons. Biodiesel is commercially available in most oilseed-producing states. , it was somewhat more expensive than fossil diesel, though it is still commonly produced in relatively small quantities (in comparison to petroleum products and ethanol fuel). Biofuels are mainly used mixed with fossil fuels. They are also used as additives. The largest biodiesel consumer is the U.S. Army. Most light vehicles on the road today in the US can run on blends of up to 10% ethanol, and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. The demand for bioethanol fuel in the United States was stimulated by the discovery in the late 90s that methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), an oxygenate additive in gasoline, was contaminating groundwater. Cellulosic biofuels are under development, to avoid upward pressure on food prices and land use changes that would be expected to result from a major increase in use of food biofuels. Biofuels are not just limited to liquid fuels. One of the often overlooked uses of biomass in the United States is in the gasification of biomass. There is a small, but growing number of people using woodgas to fuel cars and trucks all across America. The challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date. Flex-fuel vehicles are assisting in this transition because they allow drivers to choose different fuels based on price and availability. The growing ethanol and biodiesel industries are providing jobs in plant construction, operations, and maintenance, mostly in rural communities. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol industry created almost 154,000 U.S. jobs in 2005 alone, boosting household income by $5.7 billion. It also contributed about $3.5 billion in tax revenues at the local, state, and federal levels. On the other hand, in 2010, the industry received $6.646 billion in federal support (not counting state and local support). Based upon average U.S. corn yields for the years 2007 through 2012, conversion of the entire US corn crop would yield 34.4 billion gallons of ethanol which is approximately 25% of 2012 finished motor fuel demand. History The United States used biofuel in the beginning of the 20th century. For example, models of Ford T ran with ethanol fuel. Then the interest in biofuels declined until the first and second oil crisis (1973 and 1979). The Department of Energy established the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in 1974 and started to work in 1977. The NREL publish papers on biofuels. Congress also voted the Energy Policy Act in 1994 and a newer in 2005 to promote renewable fuels. Congress established regulars under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 intended to encourage the mixing of renewable fuels into our nation's motor vehicle fuel supply. Congress supported the renewable fuels program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to contain particular annual volume standards for complete renewable fuel and also for the fixed renewable fuel groups of biomass-based diesel, biofuel, and advanced biofuel. The reassessed statutory requirements also incorporate new criteria for both renewable fuels and for the feedstocks used to produce them, including lifecycle greenhouse gas emission thresholds. Legislation Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS1) The current National Renewable Fuel Standard program (RFS1) was established under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which amended the Clean Air Act by establishing the first national renewable fuel standard. The U.S. Congress gave the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the responsibility to coordinate with the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and stakeholders to design and implement this new program. The Renewable Fuel Standard called for of biofuels to be used annually by 2012, expanding the market for biofuels. The EPA announced that the 2009 Renewable Fuel Standard will require most refiners, importers, and non-oxygenate blenders of gasoline to displace 10.21% of their gasoline with renewable fuels such as ethanol. That requirement aims to ensure that at least of renewable fuels will be sold in 2009, in keeping with the targets established by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). While the RFS requirement is increasing by about 23%—from in 2008 to in 2009—the percentage requirement is increasing by nearly one third, from 7.76% in 2008 to 10.21% in 2009. The EPA determines that fuel blenders are meeting renewable fuel requirements by examining Renewable Identification Numbers that they submit to the agency. The 2009 RFS is also pushing up against what is known as the \"blend wall\". To address the blend wall issue, DOE and others are studying the use of mid-range blends, such as E15 and E20, for use in standard gasoline-burning vehicles. Allowing all gasoline blends to contain up to 20% ethanol would double the potential market for ethanol. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) In May 2009, the EPA released proposed revisions to the National Renewable Fuel Standard program. These revisions addressed changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard program as required by EISA. The revised statutory requirements establish new specific volume standards for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel that must be used in transportation fuel each year. The revised statutory requirements also include new definitions and criteria for both renewable fuels and the feedstocks used to produce them, including new greenhouse gas emission (GHG) thresholds for renewable fuels. The regulatory requirements for RFS will apply to domestic and foreign producers and importers of renewable fuel. Of these modifications, several are significantly notable. First, the volume standard under RFS2 was increased beginning in 2008 from . Thereafter, the required volume continues to increase under RFS2, eventually reaching by 2022. Volume Standards Greenhouse gas reduction thresholds EISA established new renewable fuel categories and eligibility requirements, including setting the first ever mandatory greenhouse gas reduction thresholds for the various categories of fuels. For each renewable fuel pathway, greenhouse gas emissions are evaluated over the full life cycle, including production and transport of the feedstock; land use change; production, distribution, and blending of the renewable fuel; and end use of the renewable fuel. The GHG emissions are then compared to the life cycle emissions of 2005 petroleum baseline fuels (base year established as 2005 by EISA) displaced by the renewable fuel, such as gasoline or diesel. The life cycle GHG emissions performance reduction thresholds as established by EISA range from 20 to 60 percent reduction depending on the renewable fuel category. A 2022 study found that land use change emissions resulting from the RFS2 were likely large enough to preclude corn ethanol from complying with the 20% greenhouse gas reductions required of \"conventional biofuel\" under the EISA. Renewable fuels Ethanol fuel The demand for ethanol fuel in the United States was stimulated by the discovery in the late 1990s that methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), an oxygenate additive in gasoline, was contaminating groundwater. Due to the risks of widespread and costly litigation, and because MTBE use in gasoline was banned in almost 20 states by 2006, the substitution of MTBE opened a new market for ethanol fuel. This demand shift for ethanol as an oxygenate additive took place at a time when oil prices were already significantly rising. This shift also contributed to an expansion in the use of gasohol E10 and to a sharp increase in the production and sale of E85 flex vehicles since 2002. Low ethanol blends Most cars on the road today in the U.S. can run on blends of up to 10% ethanol (E10), and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. Though E10 is mandatory only in 10 states, ethanol blends in the US are available in other states as optional or added on lower percentages as a substitute to MTBE (used to oxygenate gasoline) without any labeling, making E blends present in two-thirds of the US gas supply. Flex-fuel vehicles Ford, DaimlerChrysler, and GM are among the automobile companies that sell \"flexible-fuel\" cars, trucks, and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85% ethanol (E85). By mid-2008, there were approximately seven million E85-compatible vehicles on U.S. roads. However, a 2005 survey found that 68% of American flex-fuel car owners were not aware they owned an E85 flex. This is due to the fact that the exterior of flex and non-flex vehicles look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumer's awareness about E85s; and also the decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers can be aware they are getting an E85 vehicle. Since 2006 many new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities, and GM is also using badging with the text \"Flexfuel/E85 Ethanol\" to clearly mark the car as an E85 FFV. A major restriction hampering sales of E85 flex vehicles or fuelling with E85, is the limited infrastructure available to sell E85 to the public, as by October 2008 there were only 1,802 gasoline filling stations selling E85 to the public in the entire US, with a great concentration of E85 stations in the Corn Belt states, led by Minnesota with 357 stations, more than any other state, followed by Illinois with 189, Wisconsin with 118, and Missouri with 112. Only seven states do not have E85 available to the public, Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Vermont. The main constraint for a more rapid expansion of E85 availability is that it requires dedicated storage tanks at filling stations, at an estimated cost of USD 60,000 for each dedicated ethanol tank. Chrysler, General Motors, and Ford have each pledged to manufacture 50 percent of their entire vehicle line as flexible fuel in model year 2012, if enough fueling infrastructure develops. Regarding energy policy, President-elect Barack Obama pledged during his electoral campaign to significantly reduce oil consumption, with measures that among others include mandating all new vehicles to have FFV capability by the end of 2013. Biodiesel GreenHunter Energy, Inc. has begun commercial operations at its biodiesel refinery in Houston, Texas, that can produce of biodiesel. That production capacity makes it the largest biodiesel refinery in the United States, barely beating out the biodiesel refinery built by Imperium Renewables in Washington. For comparison, the total U.S. production capacity for biodiesel reached in 2007, although poor market conditions held 2007 production to about , according to the National Biodiesel Board (NBB). In 2006, Fuel Bio Opened the largest biodiesel manufacturing plant on the east coast of the United States in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Fuel Bio's operation is capable of producing a name plate capacity of of biodiesel per year. Methanol fuel Methanol was first produced from pyrolysis of wood, resulting in its common English name of wood alcohol. Presently, methanol is usually produced using methane (the chief constituent of natural gas) as a raw material. It may also be produced by pyrolysis of many organic materials or by Fischer–Tropsch from synthetic gas, so be called biomethanol. Production of methanol from synthesis gas using Biomass-To-Liquid can offer methanol production from biomass at efficiencies up to 75%. Widespread production by this route has a postulated potential (see Olah reference above) to offer methanol fuel at a low cost and with benefits to the environment. These production methods, however, are not suitable for small scale production. Successful test programs in Europe and the US, mainly in California, were conducted with methanol flex-fuel vehicles, known as M85 flex-fuel vehicles. Ford began development of a flexible-fuel vehicle in 1982, and between 1985 and 1992, 705 experimental FFVs were built and delivered to California and Canada, including the 1.6L Ford Escort, the 3.0L Taurus, and the 5.0L LTD Crown Victoria. These vehicles could operate on either gasoline or methanol with only one fuel system. Legislation was passed to encourage the US auto industry to begin production, which started in 1993 for the M85 FFVs at Ford. In 1996, a new FFV Ford Taurus was developed, with models fully capable of running on either methanol or ethanol blended with gasoline. This ethanol version of the Taurus became the first commercial production of an E85 FFV. The momentum of the FFV production programs at the American car companies continued, although by the end of the 1990s, the emphasis shifted to the E85 version, as it is today. Ethanol was preferred over methanol because there is a large support from the farming community, and thanks to the government's incentive programs and corn-based ethanol subsidies. In 2005, California's Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, terminated the use of methanol after 25 years and 200 million miles of successful operation, to join the expanding use of ethanol driven by producers of corn. In spite of this, he was optimistic about the future of the program, claiming \"it will be back.\" Ethanol is currently (as of 2009) priced at 2 to 3 dollars per gallon, while methanol made from natural gas remains at 47 cents per gallon. Presently there are over 60 operating gas stations in California supplying methanol in their pumps. Butanol fuel A team of chemical engineers at the University of Arkansas have developed a method for converting common algae into butanol, which can be used as fuel in existing gasoline internal combustible engines. The algae are grown on \"raceway\" troughs and the algaes growth is enhanced by delivering high concentrations of carbon dioxide through hollow fiber membranes. Questions have been raised about the amount of energy needed to produce fuel-grade ethanol compared to the amount of energy it releases upon combustion. Depending on who you ask, you may get a different answer as to whether or not ethanol from corn produces more energy than it consumes. Therefore, companies like BP and DuPont have been looking at the next generation of biofuel, specifically investigating butanol. Specific advantages to using butanol compared to ethanol include, higher energy content per kg, the ability to be blended at higher concentrations without further adaptation of vehicles, and potential to use existing storage/transport infrastructure. However, using corn as a feedstock to produce either ethanol or butanol seems infeasible without significant technology improvements regarding yields. Currently, about of butanol can be produced per bushel of corn ( l/t). Meanwhile, about of ethanol can be produced per bushel of corn ( l/t). Our current production of ethanol is about , but it requires 20% of the United States' corn crop and only replaces 1% of its petroleum use. Reaching the biofuel mandate by 2022, would be a difficult task if only using a corn grain feedstock. Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) Many cellulosic biomass materials produce methane naturally. Methane is the main component of natural gas. Naturally occurring methane is often considered a source of pollution from landfills, dairy farms, and human waste sources. The EPA routinely issues rules to reduce the emission of methane from landfills and other sources. Naturally occurring methane emissions, typically called landfill gas or biogas, are not clean enough to be introduced directly in the US National Natural Gas Pipeline system, but technology to do so has been developed. The pipeline quality gas is called Renewable Natural Gas (RNG). In July 2014 the EPA issued a ruling that RNG produced from landfills would qualify as D3 RIN qualifying fuel under RFS2. In one month’s time, D3 RIN generation soared from the 4,000 recorded for July to 3.49 million for August 2014. As can be seen by the 4,000 D3 RIN credits issued in July 2014, industry had made little progress at developing an economically viable D3 fuel prior to the EPAs ruling that RNG from landfills would qualify as a D3 fuel. D3 RIN generation has continued to increase and 2 years later in August 2016 it was 15.6 million EGE (ethanol equivalent gallons). In 2015, over 98% of D3 RIN credits issued were issued for RNG. The American Biogas Council believes 17.9 billion diesel gallon equivalents of RNG can be produced each year from the existing US waste stream. By state Louisiana Louisiana State University Agricultural Center researchers in the Louisiana Institute for Biofuels and Bioprocessing are studying the regular production of biomass for economically viable conversion to biofuels and bioenergy using existing refinery infrastructure. This project, called the LSU AgCenter Sustainable Bioproducts Initiative, involves a team of university and industry partners who are studying how to use energy cane and sweet sorghum to help reinvigorate the Louisiana sugar and chemical industries. The project will expand the United States’ southern regional agricultural sector by utilizing sweet sorghum and energy cane to produce butanol, gasoline, isoprene and byproduct chemicals. Developers believe the project eventually will contribute significantly to improving rural prosperity and job creation in the southern region of the United States. Michigan Michigan State University researcher Bruce Dale says that 30% of USA's energy can be achieved by 2030. The greenhouse emissions are reduced by 86% for cellulose compared to corn's 29% reduction. A plant is being built now in Georgia to make up to per year. Minnesota Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty signed a bill on May 12, 2008, that will require all diesel fuel sold in the state for use in internal combustion engines to contain at least 20% biodiesel by May 1, 2015. Oregon Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski signed legislation in July 2007 that will require all gasoline sold in the state to be blended with 10% bioethanol (a blend known as BE10) and all diesel fuel sold in the state to be blended with 2% biodiesel (a blend known as BD2). Oregon currently has the only biofuels station in the country that can be used by any type of vehicle. United States Department of Energy projects The United States Department of Energy has announced that it has selected six university-led advanced biofuels projects to receive up to $4.4 million, subject to annual appropriations. The awardees—Georgia Tech Research Corporation, the University of Georgia, the University of Maine, Montana State University, Steven's Institute of Technology in New Jersey, and the University of Toledo in Ohio—will all receive funding to conduct research and development of cost-effective, environmentally friendly biomass conversion technologies for turning non-food feedstocks into advanced biofuels. Combined with a university cost share of 20%, more than $5.7 million is slated for investment in these projects. Most of the projects will involve microbiology, including the University of Georgia and Montana State University projects, which are both focused on producing oils from algae. The University of Georgia will investigate the use of poultry litter to produce low-cost nutrients for algae, while Montana State, in partnership with Utah State University, will research the oil content, growth, and oil production of algae cultures in open ponds. Applying microbiology to biomass conversion, the University of Maine will study the use of bacteria to create biofuels from regionally available feedstocks, such as seaweed sludge and paper mill waste streams, while the University of Toledo will attempt to use pellets containing enzymes to efficiently convert cellulosic biomass into ethanol. In contrast, Georgia Tech Research Corporation and Steven's Institute of Technology are both investigating the gasification of biomass. Georgia Tech will evaluate two experimental gasifiers run on forest residues, while Steven's Institute will test a novel microchannel reactor that gasifies pyrolysis oil, a petroleum-like oil produced by exposing biomass sources such as wood chips to high temperatures in the absence of oxygen. Gasified biomass can be used as a gaseous fuel or passed through a catalyst to produce a wide range of liquid fuels and chemicals. Biofuel companies Unfortunately, costs of producing ethanol from cellulosic feedstock such as wood chips are still about 70% higher than production from corn, because of an extra step in the production process, when compared to production of corn-derived ethanol. Until recently, the idea of extracting ethanol from farm waste and other sources was barely clinging to life in the recesses of university campuses and federal labs, because production problems, as well as the need to bring together a vast team of specialists. Consider: Finding a bacterium from a cow's intestinal tract or from elephant dung that has the correct enzyme to degrade cellulose, and then bringing in geneticists to modify that enzyme kept this discouraging feat from ever-growing beyond its embryonic state. Now, that is all changing with a race by approximately thirty companies attempting to accomplish this alchemical feat, and in the process working directly or coordinating with: environmental groups, biotechnology firms, some major oil companies, chemical giants, auto makers, defense hawks, and venture capitalists. The winner will be whoever can make cellulosic ethanol in mass quantities for as little money per gallon as possible. With the majority of such biofuel companies (Iogen Corporation, SunOpta's BioProcess Group, Genencor, Novozymes, Dyadic International, Inc. (DYAI), Kansas City-based Alternative Energy Sources, Inc. [Nasdaq:AENS], Flex Fuels USA based in Huntsville, Alabama (now owned by Alternative Energy Sources), or BRI Energy, LLC, Abengoa Bioenergy) located in North America, the United States is in a unique position to lead the way in the development, production, and sale of a new source of energy. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM) has invested heavily into building approximately 100 corn-ethanol production plants, known as bio-refineries, and churns out about one-fifth of the country's ethanol supply. This occurred due to seasonal overcapacity in its corn syrup plants when surplus was available to produce ethanol. Moreover, ADM is in a unique position to utilize unused parts of the corn crop, and convert previously discarded waste into a viable product. The hull surrounding corn contains fiber that the Decatur, Illinois, grain-processing giant's ethanol-making microorganisms can not use. Figuring out how to convert the fiber into more sugar could increase the output of an existing corn-ethanol plant by 15%. Consequently, ADM would not have to figure out how to collect a new source of biomass but merely use the existing infrastructure for gathering corn. ADM executives want government help to build a plant that could cost between $50 million and $100 million. ADM hired the head of petroleum refining at Chevron, Patricia A. Woertz, to metamorphose ADM into the Exxon-Mobil of the ethanol industry. Meanwhile, DuPont, the chemical giant, is attempting to figure out how to construct a bio-refinery fueled by corn stover—the stalk and leaves that are left in the field after farmers harvest their crop. The company's goal is to make ethanol from cellulose as cheaply as from corn kernels by 2009. If it works, the technology could double the amount of ethanol produced by a field of corn. Cello Energy proposed to produce biofuel from wood chips and other biomass. In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency planned on blending 100.7 million gallons of biofuel to the country's fuel supply, with 70 percent of the biofuel provided by Cello Energy. However, the company declared bankruptcy in 2010 after losing a federal lawsuit for defrauding investors. Diversa Corporation, a biotech company based in San Diego, examined how biomass is converted into energy in the natural environment. They have found that the enzymes inherent in the bacteria and protozoa that inhabit the digestive tracts of the household termite efficiently convert 95% of cellulose into fermentable sugars. Using proprietary DNA extraction and cloning technologies, they were able to isolate the cellulose-degrading enzymes. By reenacting this natural process, the company created a cocktail of high-performance enzymes for industrial ethanol production enablers. Although still in the early stages of this work, the initial results are promising. Currently, these expensive enzymes cost about 25 cents per gallon of ethanol, although this price is very likely to decline by half in the coming years. Construction of the first U.S. commercial plant producing cellulosic ethanol will commence in the State of Iowa in February 2007. The Voyager Ethanol plant in Emmetsburg, owned by POET, LLC, will be converted from a conventional corn dry mill facility into a commercial-scale biorefinery producing ethanol from not only corn but also the stalk, leaves, and cobs of the corn plant. Most ethanol plants rely on natural gas to power their processing equipment. The process to be used at the Emmetsburg plant will enable the plant to make 11% more ethanol by weight of corn and 27% more by area of corn. The process cuts the need for fossil fuel power at the plant by 83% by using some of its own byproduct for power. The $200 million plant is scheduled to begin in February and take about 30 months to complete. Project completion is contingent upon partial funding from a USDOE grant, which is likely as the U.S. Government views the renewable energy project as a full-blown national security issue. Green Plains Renewable Energy claims to be the fourth largest ethanol fuel producer in North America (as of February 2012).

{"text": "The is a grouping of female manga artists who heavily influenced shōjo manga (Japanese girls' comics) beginning in the 1970s. While shōjo manga of the 1950s and 1960s largely consisted of simple stories marketed towards elementary school-aged girls, works by members of the group significantly developed shōjo manga by expanding it to incorporate new genres, themes, and subject material. Narratives and art styles in shōjo manga became more complex, and works came to examine topics such as psychology, gender, politics, and sexuality. Manga produced by the Year 24 Group brought the shōjo category into what scholars have described as its \"golden age\". As a largely notional group, the criteria used to determine the membership of the Year 24 Group varies. Individuals who have been associated with the Year 24 Group include Yasuko Aoike, Moto Hagio, Riyoko Ikeda, Toshie Kihara, Minori Kimura, Yumiko Ōshima, Nanae Sasaya, Keiko Takemiya, , and Ryōko Yamagishi. Etymology \"The Year 24 Group\" is not a proper name for a specific collective of artists, but rather a name used by critics, journalists, and academics to retroactively refer to the generation of female manga artists who emerged in the early 1970s and contributed to the growth and development of shōjo manga. Though the precise origin of the term is unknown, it was widely in use by the end of the 1970s, notably in manga critic 1979 book Twilight Times: Dőjidai no Manga no Tameni. \"Year 24\" refers to Shōwa 24 – the 24th year of the Shōwa era in the Japanese calendar, or 1949 in the Gregorian calendar. The number thus ostensibly references the year its members were born in, although only a small number of individuals associated with the Year 24 Group were actually born in 1949. History Context During the 1950s and 1960s, shōjo manga largely consisted of simple stories marketed towards elementary school-aged girls. Stories were typically sentimental or humorous in tone, and were often centered on familial drama or romantic comedy; manga scholar Rachel Thorn notes that these stories frequently focused on \"passive, pre-adolescent heroines in melodramatic situations, often involving separation from a mother.\" Authors of shōjo manga were typically men who began their careers in the genre before migrating to shōnen manga, or manga for boys. During the 1960s, the manga industry responded to an aging readership and increased competition from television by increasing the production of manga magazines and diversifying the content of their publications. Shōnen manga during this period innovated and found new audiences through the concept of gekiga, which sought to use manga to tell serious and grounded stories aimed at adult audiences; shōjo manga largely stagnated, and was generally perceived as frivolous and of low quality by critics. Though the increase in manga production during the 1960s allowed female manga artists such as Hideko Mizuno, Toshiko Ueda, and Yoshiko Nishitani to launch their careers, the sclerotic conventions and editorial standards of shōjo manga publishing of this era prevented them from achieving the degree of innovation seen in shōnen manga. The \"Ōizumi Salon\" and professional debut By the early 1970s, the majority of the male artists who had launched their careers in shōjo manga in the 1960s had migrated to shōnen manga, giving way to a new generation of female shōjo manga artists. These new artists drew inspiration from a diversity of sources, including European literature and cinema, American rock and roll culture, and the Bildungsroman genre. Magazines such as Shūkan Shōjo Comic that granted more editorial freedom to creators provided outlets for these artists to publish their work. The so-called \"Ōizumi Salon\", a rented house in Ōizumigakuenchō, Nerima, Tokyo that manga artists Moto Hagio and Keiko Takemiya shared as roommates from 1971 to 1973, came to be an important gathering point for members and affiliates of the Year 24 Group. Hagio and Takemiya made the house available to shōjo artists for use as living and working space, allowing them to both bond socially, share ideas and influences, and collaborate on manga. Notable artists who visited the Ōizumi Salon include Shio Satō, Yasuko Sakata, Yukiko Kai, Akiko Hatsu, Nanae Sasaya, , , , and . The Ōizumi Salon has been compared to Tokiwa-sō, an apartment building that housed multiple influential manga artists in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1972, two major works of shōjo manga were published by members of the group: The Rose of Versailles by Riyoko Ikeda, and The Poe Clan by Hagio. Widely acclaimed upon their release, the works attracted the attention of critics who had to that point largely ignored the shōjo genre. These works paved the way for a wave of \"literary manga\" (roughly analogous to Western graphic novels), which due to their aesthetic and literary qualities, brought shōjo manga into what has been described by scholars as its \"golden age\". Innovation of the shōjo genre The 1970s would see the publication of multiple works by the Year 24 Group that significantly contributed to the development of shōjo manga. Notable works in addition to the aforementioned Rose of Versailles and Poe Clan include Shiroi Heya no Futari (1971) by Ryoko Yamagishi, The Heart of Thomas (1974) by Moto Hagio, They Were Eleven (1975) by Hagio, From Eroica With Love (1976) by Yasuko Aoike, Kaze to Ki no Uta (1976) by Keiko Takemiya, and Toward the Terra (1977) by Takemiya. These works expanded shōjo manga to incorporate new subgenres, including science fiction, historical fiction, adventure fiction, horror, fantasy, and same-sex romance (both male-male and female-female). These stories typically focused on complex narratives that emphasized the psychology and interiority of their protagonists, and addressed controversial topics and subject material. Works that openly explored politics and sexuality came to be a defining trait of Year 24 Group manga. While pre-war girls magazines had forbidden discussion or depictions of these topics, cultural shifts in the 1970s allowed manga artists to depict these concepts more freely. Members of the Year 24 Group were shaped by the counterculture of the 1960s, particularly the New Left student protest movements; Ikeda was a member of the Japanese Communist Party, and the group generally was \"empowered by the sense of youthful rebellion and iconoclasm at the time.\" This realist style, notably in the manga of Takemiya, Ōshima, and Hagio, contributed to the popularity of shōjo manga among general audiences. Works by the group often examined issues of gender through their focus on male protagonists, a departure from earlier shōjo manga that focused on female heroines exclusively. These protagonists were often bishōnen – literally \"beautiful boys\", distinguished by their androgynous appearances – or were characters that blur gender distinctions, such as the crossdressing Oscar François de Jarjayes of The Rose of Versailles. Works focused on male protagonists were often homosocial or homoerotic in nature, and helped lay the foundation for the boys' love genre (male-male romance, also known as \"BL\" or yaoi). Stylistically, the Year 24 Group created new conventions in panel layout by departing from the rows of rectangles that were the standard at the time, creating borders that were abstracted or removed entirely. These so-called \"non-narrative\" layouts focus on communicating the emotions of the characters, and often superimpose and overlap backgrounds, characters, and dialogue to create an effect that breaks the standard narrative structure. For example, Ikeda is noted for using panel compositions that remove spatial landmarks, while Hagio often removes panels entirely to merge characters and backgrounds into a single composition. By the end of the 1970s, shōjo manga \"had ceased to be a monolithic and homogeneous genre,\" and the innovation introduced to shōjo manga by the Year 24 Group was firmly entrenched in the medium. The trend towards specialization and narrowly-targeted readerships through subgenres continued into the 1980s and 1990s, as shōjo works targeted towards young adult and adult women continued to proliferate. Members As a largely notional group, the criteria used by scholars to determine the membership of the Year 24 Group varies. Some define its membership as only the most popular and \"radical\" shōjo artists of the era – typically considered to be Hagio, Ōshima, and Takemiya, occasionally referred to using the acronym \"HOT\" – while others include every artist who frequented the Ōizumi Salon. Manga artists Yasuko Aoike Noted for her works that focus on romance, adventure, and comedy. Aoike is best known for her long-running spy parody series From Eroica with Love, serialized in Princess from 1976 to 2012. In 1991, she received the Japan Cartoonists Association Award for her series . Moto Hagio Noted as \"one of the most important creators to rise from the world of Japanese manga,\" Hagio's works were profoundly influential to the shōjo genre, introducing elements of science fiction, fantasy, and male-male romance. She has won numerous awards, and was the first shōjo manga creator to receive a Medal of Honor. Riyoko Ikeda Noted for her historical dramas that often featured foreign settings and androgynous characters. Ikeda's acclaimed series The Rose of Versailles was the first major commercial success in the shōjo genre, and proved the genre's viability as a commercial category. Toshie Kihara Noted for her historical manga, Kihara is best known for her manga series ; published in LaLa from 1977 to 1984, it follows a romance between two young men at the start of the Shōwa era. In 1984, she received the Shogakukan Manga Award in the shōjo category for her series . Minori Kimura Produced manga noted for their realistic themes and subject material, such as sexuality, health, and work. Made her professional debut at the age of 14 with Picnic, a manga published in Ribon. Yumiko Ōshima Best known for her series Wata no Kunihoshi, which won the 1978 Kodansha Manga Award and popularized the \"catgirl\" character archetype. Ōshima's works are noted for their use of outwardly \"cute\" aesthetic styles to explore deeper themes and subject material. Nanae Sasaya Noted for her works focusing on suspense, black comedy, and \"offbeat romances\". Her series Superior Observation by an Outsider won a Japan Cartoonists Association Award in 1990. Keiko Takemiya Influential in the science fiction, fantasy, and male-male romance genres. Takemiya's 1970 one-shot manga In The Sunroom is noted as the first commercially-published manga in the shōnen-ai genre, while her 1976 series Kaze to Ki no Uta is regarded as a seminal work of that genre. She received two Shogakukan Manga Awards in 1979, for Kaze to Ki no Uta and Toward the Terra. Noted for her works in the science fiction and fantasy genres. Her long-running Armageddon series, consisting of multiple one-shot stories, was serialized across multiple magazines from 1977 to 2002. Ryōko Yamagishi The creator of Shiroi Heya no Futari, noted as the first work in the yuri genre. In 1983, she won the Kodansha Manga Award in the manga category for . Other associated individuals A friend of Takemiya's and Hagio's who is credited with introducing them to magazines such as Barazoku and other literature, music, and films that would come to heavily influence their manga. An editor at Shogakukan who published the works of many Year 24 Group members, regardless of their controversial subject material or unconventional art styles. Analysis Impact Initial critical reaction to works published by the Year 24 Group was almost invariably positive, as many critics who had previously ignored shōjo manga seriously considered the genre for the first time through the group's work. Critics noted how works by the group considered women as human beings, rather than as the idealized young girls of early shōjo manga. Comiket, the world's largest comic convention, was founded by the dōjinshi circle to study the works of various manga artists, including Hagio and other members of Year 24 Group. Critic Osamu Takeuchi argues that the shift in shōjo manga that the Year 24 Group represented is an example of how shōjo manga in the 1970s was changing \"from simple entertainment to a vehicle of self-expression for the author\"; Eiji Ōtsuka compares this shift to the discovery of interiority in early Meiji fiction, while Inuhiko Yomota sees the Year 24 Group as analogous to New Wave cinema. The group's works were only marginally representative of all shōjo manga of the 1970s; artists such as Suzue Miuchi continued to create \"conventional\" shōjo manga, even at the peak of the Year 24 Group's popularity. Works by the Year 24 Group have nevertheless come to be regarded by critics as \"classics\" of the genre, both for their aesthetic and thematic quality, and for the \"visual grammar\" they established which influenced subsequent generations of manga artists. New generations of female manga artists also began to create manga about male-male romance following the emergence of the Year 24 Group, which became formalized in the boys' love genre. Many of the artist assistants and amateur artists who attended the Ōizumi Salon, such as Yasuko Sakata, Akiko Hatsu and Shio Satō, went on to become professional manga artists. These artists are sometimes referred to as the . Criticism One of the Year 24 Group's first dissenting critics was Hiroshi Aramata, who has criticized the group's \"deification\" and believes the group \"should not be singled out or treated as special.\" Manga scholar Deborah Shamoon concurs that while the works of the Year 24 Group are \"often characterized as revolutionary,\" she argues that the ascendance of the group \"was less a counterculture takeover and more a recognition by (male) editors that stories penned by female artists were and still are more popular with girl readers than works by male artists and hence more profitable.\" The largely notional nature the Year 24 Group has led to scholarly disagreement over who constitutes its membership, and the usefulness of \"the Year 24 Group\" as an organizing category in and of itself. Academic Tomoko Yamada has criticized the use of the term \"Year 24 Group\" to describe manga artists of the 1970s, arguing that the designation lumps women together based on their age, that it may perpetuate a bias against earlier manga artists, that it is overly inclusive of all female baby boomer manga artists, and that some manga artists considered part of Year 24 Group may reject the label. In his analysis of manga categories, sociologist Shinji Miyadai considers Riyoko Ikeda as separate from the Year 24 Group, instead considering her as representative of the \"popular novel style\" of manga alongside manga artists Machiko Satonaka and Yukari Ichijo.

{"text": "Heubach is a town in the Ostalbkreis district, in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is located 10 km east of Schwäbisch Gmünd, and 13 km southwest of Aalen. The town finds itself at the edge of the Rems River Valley and at the base of the Swabian Alps. Heubach is located in the Swabian region of Germany. Residents speak the Swabian German dialect. The town is bordered to the north by Böbingen an der Rems and Mögglingen, to the east Essingen, the south by Bartholomä and the west by the city of Schwäbisch Gmünd. History Heubach was first mentioned in 1234 in association with knight Hainricus de Hôbach. Rosenstein Castle, which is located on Rosenstein mountain, was first mentioned in 1282. At the end of the 13th century, Heubach and Rosenstein came into the possession of the Counts of Oettingen, before falling to the Counts of Württemberg in 1358. Subsequent to the victory of Emperor Charles IV over Eberhard II, Count of Würtemberg, in 1360 Heubach and Rosenstein fell to the Kingdom of Bohemia. However it was transferred back to Württemberg in 1377. In 1413 Heubach was enfeoffed to the Barons of Woellwarth fiefdom. Georg von Woellwarth left the spur castle on Rosenstein mountain in 1524 and built a castle in Heubach. In 1579 Duke Ludwig von Wuerttemberg purchased Heubach and Rosenstein and chartered Heubach by granting town privileges. The town hall was built in 1581. In the course of the Thirty Years' War between 1618 and 1648, Heubach was nearly wiped out and the population fell to around 10 people, but due to efforts of Württemberg's government it was rapidly rebuilt and resettled. On April 25, 1807 Oberamt Heubach was merged with Oberamt Gmünd. With the municipal reform of 1938 Oberamt Gmünd was transformed into Landkreis (district) Schwäbisch Gmünd. In the course of the district reform of 1973, Heubach now belongs to the Ostalbkreis district. Above the town of Heubach, the remains of Rosenstein Castle are still visible. The castle ruin on top of the Rosenstein mountain can be considered Heubach's landmark and is a popular tourist spot due to its impressive views over the region. On Glasenberg there is a telecommunication tower of reinforced concrete with an observation deck that also gives nice views over the area. Arts and Culture Heubach is located on the north edge of the Swabian Alb scenic drive, Schwäbische-Alb-Nordrand-Weg that provides many sights of the German countryside. Museums Since 1974 there is an undergarment museum that was set up in cooperation with the companies Triumph and Susa-Werke GmbH, which is the only museum of its kind in Germany. At Heubach's police station there is a \"Police Museum\", which originated from a private collection of a police officer. There, items from the local police are displayed that date back to 1853. The museum opens by appointment only. Religion In addition to a Protestant and a Roman Catholic church there is also a Baptist and Jehovah's Witnesses congregation. Mayors In 2011 the jurist Frederick Brütting was elected to be the successor of Klaus Maier (* 1956). Maier was in office from 1986 to 2011. Brütting started his office time on January 1, 2012 and was elected as mayor of Aalen in 2021. Joy A. Alemazung was elected in 2021 and is mayor since 2022. 1986–2011: Klaus Maier (SPD) 2012–2021: Frederick Brütting (SPD) since 2022: Joy A. Alemazung (CDU) Politics Heubach is the seat of the Rosenstein municipal association. The municipalities of Bartholomä, Böbingen an der Rems, Heuchlingen, and Mögglingen are members. Twin towns – sister cities Heubach is twinned with: Laxou, France, since 1964 Waidhofen an der Thaya, Austria, since 1982 Lauscha, Germany, since 1990 Business The intimate apparel business Triumph International was started by corsetier Johann Gottfried Spiesshofer and merchant Michael Braun as Spießhofer & Braun in Heubach in 1886. Still family owned, by now the multinational manufacturing and marketing organization operates in 120 countries around the world. It is one of the leading underwear manufacturers in the world and had annual sales of 1.7 billion Euros in 2009, and 37,515 employees. Still being resident in Heubach, meanwhile the company's global headquarters are in Bad Zurzach, Switzerland, where the first foreign subsidiary had been established in 1933. Closely linked to the history of Heubach is the evolvement of Hirschbrauerei Heubach, the long-established local brewery. Still family owned the brewery's history goes back to the 17th century, first documented proofs go back to 1725. Heubach is the home of Fritz Reu GmbH & Co. Metallwarenfabrik, maker of metal souvenirs, souvenir spoons, keychains, trinkets, coins, and also automobile medallions and hood ornaments for German car manufacturers.

{"text": "The Macy conferences were a set of meetings of scholars from various academic disciplines held in New York under the direction of Frank Fremont-Smith at the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation starting in 1941 and ending in 1960. The explicit aim of the conferences was to promote meaningful communication across scientific disciplines, and restore unity to science. There were different sets of conferences designed to cover specific topics, for a total of 160 conferences over the 19 years this program was active; the phrase \"Macy conference\" does not apply only to those on cybernetics, although it is sometimes used that way informally by those familiar only with that set of events. Disciplinary isolation within medicine was viewed as particularly problematic by the Macy Foundation, and given that their mandate was to aid medical research, they decided to do something about it. Thus other topics covered in different sets of conferences included: aging, adrenal cortex, biological antioxidants, blood clotting, blood pressure, connective tissues, infancy and childhood, liver injury, metabolic interrelations, nerve impulse, problems of consciousness, and renal function. Overview The Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation developed two innovations specifically designed to encourage and facilitate interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary exchanges; one was oral: the Macy conferences, and one was written: the Macy transactions (published transcriptions of the conferences). Macy conferences were essentially conversations held in a conference setting, with participants presenting research while it was still in process (rather than after it had been completed). These were more formal than conversations (papers were prepared ahead of time and circulated) but less formal than conferences. Macy transactions were transcriptions widely circulated to those who could not attend. These were far more informal than typical proceedings, which publish revised versions of conference papers, and served to invite additional scholars into the exchange. The explicit goal was to let a wider audience hear the experts exchange ideas and think out loud about their own work. But even participants themselves found the transactions valuable, as a way to prompt memories, and to catch comments they might have missed. A few comments were made explicitly referring to later publication of the conference discussions, so clearly participants took this into account. However, Fremont-Smith explicitly stated that actual discussion should always take priority. Participants were leading scientists from a wide range of fields. Casual recollections of several participants as well as published comments in the Transactions volumes stress the communicative difficulties in the beginning of each set of conferences, giving way to the gradual establishment of a common language powerful enough to communicate the intricacies of the various fields of expertise present. Participants were deliberately chosen for their willingness to engage in interdisciplinary conversations, or for having formal training in multiple disciplines, and many brought relevant past experiences (gained either from earlier Macy conferences or other venues). As participants became more secure in their ability to understand one another over the course of a set of conferences on a single topic, their willingness to think outside their own specializations meant that creativity increased. Conference topics Cerebral Inhibition Meeting The Macy Cybernetics Conferences were preceded by the Cerebral Inhibition Meeting, organized by Frank Fremont-Smith and Lawrence K. Frank, and held on 13–15 May 1942. Those invited were Gregory Bateson, Frank Beach, Carl Binger, Felix Deutsch, Flanders Dunbar, Julie Eisenbud, Carlyla Jacobsen, Lawrence Kubie, Jules Masserman, Margaret Mead, Warren McCulloch, Bela Mittelmann, David Rapoport, Arturo Rosenblueth, Donald Sheehan, Georg Soule, Robert White, John Whitehorn, and Harold Wolff. There were two topics: Hypnotism introduced by Milton Erickson Conditioned reflex introduced by Howard Liddell Cybernetics Conferences The Cybernetics conferences were held between 1946 and 1953, organized by the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation, motivated by Lawrence K. Frank and Frank Fremont-Smith of the Foundation. As chair of this set of conferences, Warren McCulloch had responsibility to ensure that disciplinary boundaries were not unduly respected. The Cybernetics were particularly complex as a result of bringing together the most diverse group of participants of any of the Macy conferences, so they were the most difficult to organize and maintain. The principal purpose of these series of conferences was to set the foundations for a general science of the workings of the human mind. These were one of the first organized studies of interdisciplinarity, spawning breakthroughs in systems theory, cybernetics, and what later became known as cognitive science. One of the topics spanning a majority of the conferences was reflexivity. Claude Shannon, one of the attendees, had previously worked on information theory and laid the one of the initial frameworks for the Cybernetic Conferences by postulating information as a probabilistic element which reduced the uncertainty from a set of choices (i.e. being told a statement is true, or even false, completely reduces the ambiguity of its message). Other conference members, especially Donald MacKay, sought to reconcile Shannon's view of information, which they called selective information, with theirs of 'structural' information which signified how selective information was to be understood (i.e. a true statement might acquire additional meanings in varied settings though the information exchanged itself has not changed). The addition of meaning into the concept of information necessarily brought the role of the observer into the Macy Conferences. MacKay argued that by receiving and interpreting a message, the observer and the information they perceived ceased to exist independently of one another. The individual reading and processing the information does so relative to their preexisting internal state, consisting of what they already know and have experienced, and only then acts. MacKay further muddled the role of information and its meaning by introducing the idea of reflexivity and feedback loops into his thought experiment. By claiming that the influence of the original message on the initial observer could be perceived by a separate individual, MacKay turned the second individual into an additional observer which could be elicited to react just how the initial observer did, a reaction that could then further be observed by a nested doll of observers ad infinitum. Reflexive feedback loops continued to come up during the Macy Conferences and became a prominent issue during its later discussions as well, most notably in the discussions regarding behavioral patterns of the human mind. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, also attendees, had previously worked on designing the first mathematical schema of a neuron based on the idea that each neuron had a threshold level that was to be reached, via excitation signals from incoming neurons, before firing its own signal onto others. Similarly to how Shannon had previously proven with his work in relay and switch circuits, McCulloch and Pitts proved that neural networks were capable of carrying out any boolean algebra calculations. At the Macy Conferences, McCulloch proposed that the firing of a neuron can be associated with an event or interaction taking place in the external world which provides sensory stimulus that is then picked up by the nervous system and processed by the neurons. But McCulloch also showed how a neural network's signal pathway could be set up reflexively with itself causing the neurons to continuously fire onto each other in a 'reverberating' circular feedback loop without any original 'firing' signal or any new additional incoming signals. McCulloch claimed this accounted for conscious phenomena in which individuals' world view, or the reaffirmation of their senses' perceived external stimulus, was cognitively distorted or all together missing as seen in individuals with phantom limb syndrome (claiming to feel an arm that has been amputated or lost) or hallucinations (perceived sensory stimulus without an original external signal). Lawrence Kubie, another attending conference member and a psychiatrist, noted how repetitive and obsessive behaviors manifesting themselves in neurotics bore a resemblance to the behavior enacted by McCulloch's 'reverberating' loops. Shannon had developed a maze-solving device which attendees of the Macy Conferences likened to a rat. Shannon's 'rat' was designed and programmed to find its marked goal when dropped at any point in a maze by giving it the ability to recall on past experiences, previous paths it had taken around the maze, so as to help it reach its endpoint - which it did repeatedly. Though goal-oriented, Shannon showed how his rat's design was prone to erratic behavior that negated its original function entirely via reflexive feedback loops. If Shannon's rat encountered itself in a path in which its 'memory' failed to fire correctly, that is to recall the paths which lead it to its goal, it would get stuck in an endless loop chasing its tail. Completely abandoning its goal-oriented design, Shannon's rat had seemingly become neurotic. The Macy Conferences failed to reconcile the subjectivity of information (its meaning) and that of the human mind but succeeding in showing how concepts such as that of the observer, reflexivity, black box systems, and neural networks would have to be approached in conjunction and eventually overcome in order to form a complete working theory of the mind. The Macy Conferences were discontinued shortly after the ninth conference.

Neuropharmacological Conferences First Neuropharmacological Conference, 26–28 May 1954 Participants: William Borberg, Seymour Kety, Ernest Sharrer, Mary Brazier, Horace Magoun, Carl Pfieffer Topics: LSD Group Processes Conferences The Group Processes Conferences were held between 1954 and 1960. They are of particular interest due to the element of reflexivity: participants were interested in their own functioning as a group, and made numerous comments about their understanding of how Macy conferences were designed to work. For example, there were a series of jokes made about the disease afflicting them all, interdisciplinitis., or how multidisciplinarian researchers were neither fish nor fowl. When Erving Goffman made a guest appearance at the Third conference, he explicitly prefaced his comments by saying that his ideas were partly speculative, and Frank Fremont-Smith responded by stating that their goal was to discuss ideas that had not been crystallized.

{"text": "Denkendorf is a municipality in the district of Esslingen in Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany. It is located 5 km south of Esslingen, and 14 km southeast of Stuttgart. Geographical location Denkendorf is just outside the Filder on the southern slopes of Körsch - and Sulzbach valley. Municipality arrangement Denkendorf includes the homestead Spieth-Hof and the house Friedrichsmühle as well as proofs of the former village \"Der hangende Hof\". Neighboring communities Adjacent municipalities are Esslingen am Neckar in the north, Deizisau in the northeast, Köngen in the east Unterensingen in the south, Neuhausen auf den Fildern in the west and Ostfildern in the northwest (all Esslingen district). History Denkendorf is first mentioned in a document of 1129 in which Pope Honorius II took the monastery of Denkendorf under his protection. During the construction of the Autobahn (A8 today) in 1935, a series of Alemannic burial sites was uncovered, which are dated in the period shortly before 700 A.D. After the end of World War II, the population soared, quadrupling from 1945 to 1995. Despite the district and municipal reform of 1973/74 Denkendorf maintained its independence. Crest The coat of arms is a golden Lorraine cross with a golden letter D to the left and to right, all on a solid royal blue background. Twinning Denkendorf has been twinned with the city of Meximieux in France (near Lyon) since 1986. The twinning involves summer camps, annual festivals, tournaments and student exchanges. Economy and Infrastructure Transportation From 1926 to 1978 Denkendorf was connected by the tram service of the with the county town of Esslingen am Neckar. In Nellingen there is also access to the lines U7 and U8 of the Stuttgart light rail. The national road 10 (B 10) can be accessed via the Körsch valley or the Nellingen ring road in a few minutes and connects with Stuttgart, Esslingen, Plochingen and Göppingen. The Bundesautobahn A8 leads south past the town. It connects Stuttgart with Munich and Karlsruhe. The two nearest junctions are to the East - Wendlingen (just 10 min.) and to the West - Neuhausen (5 min.) Also in the municipal district is the Sulzbach viaduct that leads the Autobahn over the eponymous river. The Stuttgart Airport can be reached in less than 15 minutes.

{"text": "General elections were held in Belize on 30 June 1993. Although the People's United Party received the most votes, the United Democratic Party–National Alliance for Belizean Rights alliance won the most seats. Voter turnout was 72.1%. Background British forces, kept in Belize by agreement of its government since independence in 1981, were scheduled to leave in 1993 or 1994. There was widespread belief that Belize would fall prey to Guatemalan incursions if the British left. The PUP won the previous election with a two-seat majority. However, by early 1993 its majority had increased to six thanks to newly elected UDP Area Rep. William Usher of Toledo West crossing the floor to the PUP days after the 1989 election, and a January 1993 by-election win in Freetown after the UDP's Derek Aikman was forced to resign due to bankruptcy. Success in the subsequent March municipal elections also gave the PUP added confidence. Meanwhile, the UDP had been in apparent disarray since 1991, when a group led by longtime Area Rep. Philip Goldson broke with the party to form the National Alliance for Belizean Rights over disagreements on how to handle the longstanding Belizean–Guatemalan territorial dispute. This all compelled Prime Minister George Price to call elections nearly 18 months early (they were not constitutionally due until at least December 1994). With Price's move the UDP and NABR promptly sought a coalition to achieve victory at the polls. However, Goldson was the NABR's only successful candidate. Although the PUP won a majority of votes nationwide, the UDP/NABR coalition won a slim majority of seats and therefore formed the next government. The election would be Price's last as PUP leader after over 35 years. He was succeeded as party leader in 1996 by Said Musa. Results The results were extremely close in several constituencies. In Caribbean Shores and Stann Creek West the UDP–NABR candidates won by 40 and 34 votes. The UDP–NABR candidate in Cayo North won by 18 votes. In Orange Walk North, the UDP–NABR won by five votes. The PUP candidate in Belize Rural North won by four votes, while the UDP–NABR candidate in Toledo East was elected by the same margin. The PUP candidate in Corozal Southwest won by three votes, while in Collet, the UDP–NABR candidate won by a single vote. One NABR candidate, Philip Goldson, was elected.

{"text": "The Mascarene coot (Fulica newtonii) is an extinct species of coot that inhabited the Mascarene islands of Mauritius and Réunion. Long known from subfossil bones found in the Mare aux Songes swamp on the former island, but only assumed from descriptions to also have been present on the latter, remains have more recently been found on Réunion also. Early travellers' reports from Mauritius were, in reverse, generally assumed to refer to common moorhens, but it seems that this species only colonized the island after the extinction of the endemic coot. Description The Mascarene coot was a large bird and while not flightless, it had reduced flying ability, so that if pursued, it would have even more preferred to escape by diving than it is already a general habit of the coots. As the bird had considerable stamina, it could have easily crossed the ocean between the islands, explaining why a single species occurred on both islands. The birds looked like oversized Eurasian coots, being about 45 cm long, but as they were more likely derived from the red-knobbed coot, it is not clear whether the distinguishing red knobs (which are easily overlooked) on top of the white frontal shield were not present or simply not reported by Dubois, who described the species in some detail in 1674 as \"Waterhens which are as large as fowls. They are always black, and have a large white crest on the head.\" Extinction All terrestrial Rallidae species on the Mascarene islands originated in Madagascar and were victims of cat predation which led to a decline in population. However, the primary cause of extinction was over hunting. There is one extant Rallidae species, the Eurasian Moorhen Gallinula chloropus pyrrhorrhoa that colonized the islands after the extinction of the Mascarene Coot. Dubois is the last author to mention the coot on Réunion. In 1667, François Martin had already complained that hunters had killed off the population on the Etang de Saint-Paul, although the bird was generally considered to be of disagreeable taste: The species fared little better on Mauritius, with Leguat being, in 1693, the last to record the endemic poules d'eau, saying they were \"already rare\". Apart from hunting, settlement activity leading to destruction of the marshland habitat seems to have played a major role in the species' extinction.

{"text": "Edmond Lee Browning (March 11, 1929 – July 11, 2016) was an American bishop. He was the 24th presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. Education, ordination, early ministry Browning received his seminary education from the University of the South, commonly known as Sewanee. While there he was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1952, followed by the postgraduate Bachelor of Divinity in 1954. On July 2, 1954, he was ordained to the diaconate. His ordination to the priesthood took place on May 23, 1955, in the Episcopal Diocese of West Texas. He was married to Patricia Alline Sparks on September 10, 1953. Together they had five children; Mark, Paige, Philip, Peter, and John. Browning began his ministry as a priest in Corpus Christi, Texas, as an assistant at the Church of the Good Shepherd from 1954 to 1956, then as rector of the Church of the Redeemer in Eagle Pass, Texas, from 1956 to 1959. Japan and Europe In 1959, Browning and his wife moved to Okinawa and began what would become a 12-year span in Japan. He was priest-in-charge of All Souls Church, Okinawa, until 1963 when he and his wife went to Kobe to study at the Language School; they remained in Kobe until 1965. On returning to Okinawa, Bishop Browning served at St. Matthew's Church in Oruku until 1968. On January 5, 1968, Browning was consecrated the first Missionary Bishop of Okinawa. He remained in that post until May 16, 1971, when he left Japan for Nice to assume the post of Bishop of the Convocation of American Churches in Europe. At the time of his appointment to the European See by Presiding Bishop John Hines, he was the first active, full-time bishop to be appointed to the post. Previously the position had been occupied by various diocesan bishops. As bishop in Europe, Browning had jurisdiction over Episcopal churches in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Italy and France. Browning oversaw the closing of the Episcopal Church of the Holy Spirit in Nice, in connection with the withdrawal of U.S. forces from France. The congregation merged with a Church of England parish, Holy Trinity, in Nice. The Cathedral Church of the Holy Trinity, commonly known as the American Cathedral in Paris, had become the seat of the Bishop-in-charge in 1922, but for various reasons, Browning chose not to move to Paris but lived in Wiesbaden, Germany. Return to the United States Browning returned to the United States in June 1974 to work at the Episcopal Church Center in New York City as Executive for National and World Mission on the Executive Council of the Church. In 1976, he was elected Bishop of Hawaii and was installed at the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew, Honolulu on August 1 of that year. He was the second Bishop of Hawaii since the Missionary District of Honolulu was granted status as a diocese in 1969. Overall, he was the sixth bishop since 1862 when Bishop Thomas Nettleship Staley arrived in Honolulu at the invitation of Hawaii's King Kamehameha IV. Browning succeeded Bishop E. Lani Hanchett, who had died in office the previous year at the age of 56. Presiding Bishop On September 19, 1985, Browning was elected to succeed the Most Reverend John Maury Allin as Presiding Bishop at the General Convention held in Anaheim, California. His election to the 12-year term came on the fourth ballot of the House of Bishops and was ratified overwhelmingly by a voice vote of the House of Deputies. Shortly after his election, Browning said of his vision for the Episcopal Church, \"There are tremendous global issues that face us all. My hope is that the Church can continue to hold these issues before the full membership, as well as society, to bring about some well-being for all. I think the Church has a role in being both prophetic in holding up issues, and using all its influences to try to bring about better conditions for the poor, the hungry, both in this country as well as in the global village.\" He also said, \"“I want to be very clear: This church of ours is open to all — there will be no outcasts — the convictions and hopes of all will be honored.\" Browning was installed at Washington National Cathedral as the 24th Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church on January 16, 1986. In his sermon, he began to address the deepening rift within the church over issues such as the ordination of women and homosexuality, by saying: \"(Do not ask me) to honor one set of views and disregard the other. I may agree with one, but I will respect both...the unity of this church will be maintained not because we agree on everything but because -- hopefully -- we will leave judgment to God.\" Browning's theologically liberal views earned him both admiration from progressives and intense criticism by the conservative wing of the church, and the rift, primarily over whether openly homosexual clergy may be ordained and whether gay and lesbian couples' unions may be blessed by the church, grew during his tenure. The tensions broke into a personal public exchange at the 1991 General Convention in Phoenix, Arizona, during a session of the House of Bishops, between the conservative Bishop John H. MacNaughton of the Diocese of West Texas and Bishop John Spong of the Diocese of Newark, prompting Browning to call for an unusual closed-door session of the bishops. Browning also supported the adoption of a pro-choice stance on abortion by the Episcopal Church at their 71st General Convention in 1994, the first taken by an Anglican Communion province. The last year of Browning's term was shadowed by a financial scandal when it was revealed in May 1995, that Ellen F. Cooke, the former treasurer of the ECUSA, had diverted $2.2 million to her own use. Cooke was national treasurer from her appointment by Browning in 1988 until he forced her to resign in January 1995 due to her abrasive management style. The diversions, which were uncovered after her departure, are thought to have started in 1990. The revelation of embezzlement caused particular resentment because Cooke had implemented budget cuts and staff layoffs at the same time that she was living a lavish lifestyle financed, in part, on embezzled funds. Cooke had unusual power because she served as both treasurer and chief administrator. Browning admitted that Cooke's embezzlement had gone undetected because she had \"absolute control over auditing\" and had prevented any outside checking of accounts. Browning forcefully rejected calls that he resign for not exercising proper oversight over Cooke. Cooke was convicted and served five years in prison, and the church recovered all but $100,000 of the embezzled funds. During his final year as Presiding Bishop, his book A Year of Days with the Book of Common Prayer was published. Retirement Browning retired on December 31, 1997, and was succeeded by the Most Reverend Frank Griswold. He and his wife Patti made their retirement home in Oregon, where they farmed blueberries in the Hood River Valley. Browning died on July 11, 2016. His funeral was on July 19, 2016, at Trinity Cathedral in Portland. References Further reading External links The Electronic Clerical Directory -Church Publishing, Inc.

WMUZ-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 50,000 watts. The studios and transmitter are on Capitol Avenue near Burt Road in the Weatherby section of Detroit. History The station signed on the air on . The call sign was WMUZ. The station originally was powered at 110,000 watts, before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) set 50,000 watts as the maximum for stations in the Detroit area. WMUZ-FM reduced its power to the standard 50,000 watts when it relocated to a taller tower. In effect, it kept the same Class B coverage area, despite the reduction in power. WMUZ-FM has always been owned by Crawford Broadcasting. Its original general manager was Dr. Al Black while Crawford Broadcasting founder Percy Crawford was the president. After Percy's death, his son Donald took over his role. In addition to carrying brokered Christian radio programs, WMUZ once aired ethnic shows on the weekend, including broadcasts in Polish, Romanian, Arabic and German. On August 24, 2017, Crawford Broadcasting acquired a Detroit AM station at 1200 kHz. It put the WMUZ call sign on that station, requiring 103.5 to add the \"-FM\" suffix to its call letters.

{"text": "Star Voyager is an outer space shooter for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The gameplay is a first-person shooter from inside the cockpit of a spaceship. The player navigates \"sub spaces\" of a larger \"world map.\" Gameplay takes place between different subspaces. This game was released in Japan as . Gameplay The plot centers around a lone pilot in a spacecraft attempting to protect a transport ship, the CosmoStation Noah, full of planetary refugees from a fleet of intergalactic terrorists known as the Molok Wardrivers. The player's primary goal is to eliminate all enemy fleets before they can surround the stationary Cosmostation Noah. The player may also visit up to eight different planets in search of engine and weapon upgrades for their ship, may seek repairs at up to five space stations in addition to CosmoStation Noah, and may also visit an asteroid field, and a black hole from which escape is difficult but not impossible. The game is won if the player defeats the enemy armada and safely returns to base. However, the game is lost if the enemy fleet reaches the CosmoStation Noah, the player enters the black hole, the player's ship runs out of fuel crystals, or if life support fails. Gameplay occurs on a 10x10 grid that is randomized at the start of each game with the exceptions of the player and CosmoStation Noah which will always begin in the top left, and the five initial Molok Wardriver fleets will begin in the bottom right. To progress through the grid, the player must select their destination coordinates either through the HUD or the select menu grid, and hold down the B button to charge enough power to travel to as many sectors as required to reach their destination, as identified by the number on the bottom-center of the HUD. The number of leaps charged is indicated by icons in the upper-left gauge. As gameplay progresses, additional fleets may join the Molok Wardriver armada. Any planets or space stations they encounter during their trek to the CosmoStation Noah will be destroyed, limiting the resources the player will have to mount an attack. In order to destroy the enemy fleets, the player must warp to their coordinates and destroy the fleet's spacecraft and mothership, which will endlessly deploy enemy spacecraft as long as it remains operational. The player must raise their shields in the select menu in order to minimize damage taken to the ship. The player's fuel crystals will deplete normally over time, and faster during warping or sustaining damage. Therefore, it is necessary to visit space stations to refuel to prolong gameplay. They can also repair damaged systems which include radar, engines, and weapons, but a malfunctioning life support system can be repaired only at the CosmoStation Noah. Depending on the amount of damage taken, the engines may become inoperable, one or both laser cannons can malfunction, and radar can become difficult to use.

{"text": "General elections were held in Belize on 14 December 1984. The result was a victory for the opposition United Democratic Party, which won 21 of the 28 seats. Voter turnout was 75.0%. Background The elections were the first in Belize since it achieved full independence from the United Kingdom in 1981. In its more than 30 years of existence, the ruling People's United Party had never lost an election at the national level, whilst the opposition had never won more than six seats (out of a possible eighteen in 1974). However, by 1984 the PUP were presiding over an economy in recession and that had just recently been bailed out by the IMF. The party was internally fractured and faced a United Democratic Party that had made significant gains since losing the last general election in 1979. Senator Manuel Esquivel – who Prime Minister George Price defeated in his own House constituency in 1979 – became UDP leader in December 1983. The ongoing border dispute with Guatemala was also a campaign issue, with the UDP criticising Price's negotiations. The UDP advocated for foreign direct investment to help reduce the unemployment rate. Just a few months before the election, Price ordered a redistricting of electoral boundaries. This created 10 new constituencies for a total of 28, but the majority were upset because of claims that the PUP drew the boundaries with victory in mind. Esquivel was elected in the newly created Caribbean Shores House constituency, while Price himself was defeated in his Freetown constituency after over 30 years of continuous service in the House of Representatives and its predecessors. Esquivel succeeded Price as prime minister to become the first non-PUP leader in the nation's history. Price continued to lead the PUP from outside the National Assembly while Florencio Marin became Leader of the Opposition.

{"text": "KCBC-FM (94.1 FM, \"KCBC 94\") was a radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, from 1949 to 1952. Its studios were located at 2323 Grand Avenue on the near west side of Des Moines. The original transmitter and tower were also located on the property until 1950. In 1950, KCBC purchased the former WHO-FM transmitter and tower on top of the Equitable Building at 6th and Locust in downtown Des Moines. Format The format that KCBC-FM adopted was an easy listening format that was targeted at people riding the city's buses. At the rear of KCBC's Grand Avenue property there was a barn where they installed FM receivers in the city's buses. The plan to target music and advertisements to the city's bus riders was not a profitable one, and after just four years, KCBC-FM left the air, donating their transmitter to the Des Moines Public Schools. The school district used the transmitter to put KDPS on air the same year on 88.1 FM. After KCBC-FM's license was deleted on December 9, 1952, no other station in Des Moines used the 94.1 frequency until 2005, when a low-powered radio station from Grand View University, KGVC-LP, signed on, which later shared frequency with KDRA-LP.

{"text": "Katherine Chancellor is a fictional character from the CBS Daytime soap opera The Young and the Restless, portrayed by Jeanne Cooper. Created and introduced by show creator William J. Bell in November 1973, Cooper's Katherine was introduced in an effort to increase the show's struggling ratings. When Bell's plan proved successful, Cooper was signed to a contract. Cooper went on to become one of the longest-running cast members in the show's history, ending her nearly 40-year run on May 3, 2013, five days before her death. Throughout Katherine's history, a majority of her storylines have focused on her controversial and chaotic relationship with Jill Abbott. The feud is one of the longest-running feuds in the history of American soap operas. The rivalry was ignited by Jill's affair with Katherine's husband, Phillip Chancellor II, and how Katherine's attempt to win back his affections leads to his death. After Phillip's death, the women fight over Jill and Phillip's son, Phillip III, as well as numerous other men including Katherine's husband, Rex Sterling. A 2003 plot twist leads to Katherine and Jill believing they are mother and daughter; however, this plot is undone in 2009 by head writer Maria Arena Bell and Katherine is given another son, Tucker McCall. Cooper is regarded as an icon of the genre, with some critics believing her character and performance are chiefly responsible for the soap opera's success and longevity. She is also famed for having her own facelift performed onscreen in 1984, as Katherine gets the same procedure within the story. It is referred to as daytime television's first \"extreme makeover\". Casting The character was introduced by Bell, after he was disappointed with the series' weak ratings, and hired Cooper as a quick fix to add controversy to the storylines. In 2010, Cooper said she was called in by producer John Conboy for the role, who thought she was \"such a good actress\" and \"hoped she would be interested in daytime\". The actress signed a three-year contract and expected to depart after its expiration, but became a crucial character. Beverly Garland substituted for Cooper in the role in January 1981 for a few days when she fell ill. Gisele MacKenzie briefly substituted for Cooper for six episodes in August 1986. Cooper also appeared as Katherine on The Bold and the Beautiful for two episodes on October 31 and November 1, 2005. In 2005, Cooper was awarded with the Daytime Emmy Award for Lifetime Achievement. In 2008, after several years of being nominated, Cooper received the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress. In 1989, Cooper won Soap Opera Digest'''s Editor's Award along with the award for Outstanding Lead Actress. In October 2011, it was announced Cooper had taken a medical leave, and the role was temporarily recast with Michael Learned. Shortly after, it was announced Cooper had returned to work, reclaiming the role on December 23, 2011. Cooper's final appearance as Katherine aired on May 3, 2013, five days before her death. Development Characterization Katherine has been referred to as \"The Dame of Genoa City\" and \"The Duchess\". Cooper has said every time she goes to work, she \"assumes somebody is watching for the first time.\" The actress has said a longtime fan became attached to the character \"because with all her money, she still had the same problems they did–it's just nicer to go through it all with money!\" Cooper has also said she felt it was \"so smart\" for the show to start Katherine off as a drunk, \"because that has given her such a range of personality traits to express over the years.\" In 2012, she felt Katherine had been \"pretty dumb\" because she had been acting as a minister, also stating the character becoming a minister was \"funny\". Afterward, she told the producers, \"Fun is fun, but Katherine is not a minister!\" Feud with Jill Katherine is known for her rivalry with Jill Foster Abbott which has lasted for nearly four decades, becoming the longest rivalry on any American soap opera. Their storyline has included believing they were mother and daughter for years, though it was proven false. On the rivalry, BuddyTV wrote: \"Nothing spells rivalry like the on-going feud between Jill Foster Abbott and Katherine Chancellor.\" Of working with Brenda Dickson who originated the role of Jill, Cooper said: \"Brenda had as much fun with the Katherine/Jill relationship as Jess and I did. When there was the 'Who Killed Phillip?' storyline and our characters were in court, and being thrown about, a faction of fans lined up at CBS with posters marching, and this group flew in from the east coast. And they were pro- Brenda. Then, I in turn said to her, 'Well all these people must have gotten pregnant by someone else’s husband.' They had to get us out of the studio because we had death threats! They would say that I or she 'deserved to die.' Oh, the studio was very quiet about that, and they had police stand there. It was wild!\" In 1993, Katherine was diagnosed with breast cancer and shared several tender scenes with Jill. Nancy Reichardt of the Los Angeles Times noted the characters were acting out of character; she wrote: \"Katherine's breast cancer scare was touching and seeing Katherine and Jill come together added an intriguing new dimension to their relationship. To confuse us, the show has thrown out this budding friendship as if it never happened. How much more moving it would have been if these two women faced Katherine's request for Jill to name her child Phillip as former adversaries trying to put the past behind them instead of as bitter enemies of days gone by.\" Of working with Cooper, Walton has stated: \"I thank God every day for that woman. She feeds me. She is like a shot in the arm when you see her in the morning. She is funny and sharp and I love her.\" A writer from the Jamaica Gleaner noted fans have been getting restless with Jill's newfound closeness to Katherine, writing: \"Katherine and Jill are at their best when they are at each other's throats.\" Cooper has said of the storyline where she returned to Jabot: \"Since I went back into the business of business, I've been taking away some of Jill's power. You wanna go broke? Leave your company in the hands of Jill! The other day, we were filming some confrontational scenes, and Jess [Walton] says, 'Doesn't it feel good?' And the crew is like: 'Good! The girls are at it again!'\" Lilana Novakovich of The Record noted that the rivalry between women has \"outlived most marriages.\" Cooper stated: \"The audience - both young and old - relate to the Kay/Jill relationship\". Walton describes their relationship as \"incredible\" and said: \"The love and the hate is so mixed, and there is never any telling when it will bubble out now. It used to be, “This month I like her... this month I hate her.” Now, it’s more from moment to moment.\" Death Jeanne Cooper died on May 8, 2013. On May 28, the series dedicated an entire episode to Cooper in which those closest to her reminisced about their time with her. Executive producer Jill Farren Phelps also revealed that in addition to the memorial tribute for Cooper, the writers would also incorporate Katherine Chancellor's death into the series. Throughout most of the summer, Katherine being off screen is explained as being off on vacation with her husband, Murphy. Phelps denied rumors the show was planning to recast and revealed Kay's exit would be \"as dramatic and meaningful as possible\". Phelps said the ramifications of the character's death would be big, especially in regard to what would happen with the character's company, Chancellor Industries. However, Phelps could not comment on what would happen to the iconic Chancellor Mansion set. It was revealed that Katherine's last words were adlibbed by Cooper herself. Cooper's real life son, Corbin Bernsen, officiated Katherine's memorial as Father Todd. Cooper's co-star, Daniel Goddard, revealed on Facebook that filming for Katherine's memorial began on July 16, and was slated to air on September 3 and 4. Entertainment Weekly later revealed Katherine's death would be acknowledged on August 16, 2013. Despite Katherine's family and friends being blindsided as they initially come to welcome her home, a fight immediately ensues over her fortune. Storylines Background Katherine is the daughter of Army intelligence officer, Walter Shepherd, and his wife. She was born on October 25, 1928, in Genoa City. Katherine attends high school with several Genoa City residents including best friend, John Abbott, and his future wife, Dina. Katherine is even named godmother to their daughter, Ashley. After her graduation from Genoa City University, Katherine marries her high school and college classmate, Gary Reynolds. They have a son, Brock in 1952. When we first heard Katherine Chancellor refer to her son Brock Reynolds, his father Gary had passed away years earlier, and he was cavorting on his inheritance in Europe with Lorie Brooks, daughter of newspaper editor Stuart Brooks, while attending college. Brock was estranged from his mother, and it was implied that after his father's untimely death and her remarriage, he had gone rather wild with sex and drugs. Katherine's new husband Phillip Chancellor II was deeply rooted in the history of Genoa City, which was founded by Phillip's great-great-grandfather Civil War hero Garfield Dandridge Chancellor. Garfield Dandridge Chancellor's company built many of the early buildings in Genoa City, which are now considered historical landmarks, but the show begins with Phillip Chancellor II running Chancellor Industries. 1973–1998 When Katherine is first introduced, she and Phillip have been married for 12 years, but the marriage is crumbling due to Katherine's drinking. After discovering Phillip's affair with Jill (Brenda Dickson), she convinces Brock (Beau Kazer) to romance Jill. However, Phillip files for divorce when he learns Jill is pregnant with his child. In August 1975, after Phillip returns from obtaining a divorce, Kay tries to win him back and ends up driving their car off a cliff. Phillip dies after a deathbed wedding to Jill. To honor Phillip's memory, Katherine decides to get sober. In the late 1970s, Katherine falls for Derek Thurston (Joe Ladue), who tricks her into marriage, despite his love for Jill. However, in exchange for staying in the marriage, Katherine would set up a $100,000 trust fund for Jill's son, Phillip Chancellor III. When Derek's ex-wife, Suzanne Lynch, drugs Kay and sends her to the sanitarium, Kay is presumed dead in a fire. Derek and Jill marry only for Katherine to show up at the wedding to reclaim her fortune, and her husband. Katherine put her faith in Derek and put him in charge of Chancellor Industries; however, when the company begins to fail, she hires Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) to take Derek's place. Katherine later becomes godmother to Victor and Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott)'s daughter, Victoria. In an attempt to save her marriage, Katherine and Derek go on a cruise. However, after realizing her marriage is over, Katherine jumps over board and is taken hostage by her savior, Filipe Ramirez. They fall in love and she divorces Derek for Filipe. In 1984, Katherine went under the knife for a facelift with her close friend, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), by her side despite her feud with Jill, Liz's daughter. Katherine later romances tennis pro, Brent Davis, the former lover of Dina Abbott. When Brent discovers he is dying and decides to tell Ashley he is her biological father, Dina and Katherine fail to talk him out of it. An angry Dina tries to kill Brent, but accidentally shoots Kay; however, she quickly recovers. When Katherine discovers Jill's affair her husband John's son, Jack (Terry Lester), she exposes them which leads to John having a stroke. In May 1986, when Jill is shot, Katherine is one of the suspects. Katherine and Jill then battle over Phillip III (Thom Bierdz). To cope, Phillip turns to drinking. With help from Katherine and Jill, he gets sober. After Phillip's supposed death in 1989, Katherine and Jill team up to take custody of Phillip Chancellor IV from Phillip III's widow, and get back Phillip's fortune. However, Nina wins that battle. Jill later hires conman, Brian Romalotti, aka Rex Sterling (Quinn Redeker) to romance Katherine and steal her fortune, but the plan backfires when the duo actually falls in love and marry. Later, Rex's former cellmate, Clint Radison finds Marge Cotrooke (also played by Cooper), who is a dead ringer for Kay and switches her with the real Katherine. Turned off by his wife's behavior, Rex divorces \"Katherine\" for Jill. With Rex gone, Clint begins selling off Katherine's assets, starting with the company. However, Brock returns and rescues his mother and her maid, Esther Valentine (Kate Linder) exposing the scheme. However Katherine and Marge form a bond Katherine helps gets Marge released from prison, realizing she was innocent. Katherine and Rex eventually remarry when he fakes a heart attack. Katherine later becomes the godmother and namesake to Esther's daughter, Katherine Valentine aka Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson). To help Esther impress her love interest Norman Peterson (Mark Haining), Katherine and Rex agree to pretend to be Esther's servants. With encouragement from Norman, Esther convinces Kay to put her in her will. However, Norman is unwilling to wait for Katherine's death, and breaks into the safe. Rex discovers him and Norman shoots and kills him in late 1994. Katherine forgives Esther and includes her in her will once again. 1998–2005 In July 1998, Jill discovers a letter from Phillip II leaving the Chancellor Mansion to her. Jill tries to evict Katherine who finds a legal loophole which results in Katherine and Jill being forced to share the house. Jill nearly drives Katherine to drink again; instead, Katherine runs off and contemplates suicide. Lost and broke, after being robbed, Katherine is taken in by a homeless girl, Mac (Ashley Bashioum). Katherine is shocked when Mac is revealed to be her granddaughter, Brock's daughter from an affair during his time in India. Kay brings Brock to town and reunites her family by moving them into the estate. When Brock leaves town, Katherine petitions for sole custody of Mac from her mother, Amanda Browning (Denice Duff). When Amanda reveals she has also run away from her husband, Ralph Hunnicutt (Angelo Tiffe, Daniel Quinn), Katherine convinces her to move into the mansion. Ralph shows up to cause trouble and the two eventually leave town together. In 2003, Katherine and Jill are mortified when they are mistakenly led to believe they are mother and daughter. The revelation forces Mackenzie to end her marriage to Jill's son, Billy Abbott (Ryan Brown) due to them being cousins. Jill and Katherine eventually form a bond, despite their feud still remaining as intense as ever. Katherine begins having nightmares about giving away a baby, believing she gave Phillip away at birth to a woman named Violet Montgomery, and gave Jill another child who was raised as Phillip Chancellor III. The baby turns out to be Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard), who had recently \"married\" the scheming Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz). However, Katherine forgives Amber and they eventually become close friends. 2005–2013 In 2005, Cooper appears as Katherine on The Bold and the Beautiful when she is approached by Massimo Marone (Joseph Mascolo) who introduces her to Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery), the daughter of Katherine's old business acquaintance, John Douglas. Katherine is revealed to be the true owner of Forrester Creations, thanks to a trust set up by Stephanie's father. Katherine helps Stephanie reclaim the company from her estranged husband, Eric Forrester (John McCook). In 2008, Katherine has a minor stroke while secretly trying to help Marge - who has recently returned - get into rehab. In November of that year, Katherine and Marge get into a car accident on the way to the rehab center. Katherine is mistaken for Marge and pronounced dead at the scene. Kay is rescued by Marge's friend, Patrick Murphy (Michael Fairman), believing she is Marge. Katherine regains her memories and convinces Murphy to take her home. However, Jill is hesitant, believing Katherine is really Marge, a belief that is affirmed when Katherine fails several test comparing her and Jill's DNA. Despite this, Katherine convinces her closest friends, including Victor and Nikki, to believe her identity. Meanwhile, Katherine and Murphy become engaged. When Katherine's DNA matches Brock's and doesn't match Jill's, it is confirmed that they are not related, leaving Jill devastated. Katherine and Murphy are married in May 2009. In the summer of 2009, it is revealed Cane is not Jill's son, but a man hired by the real Phillip who faked his death because he was gay. Katherine becomes an ordained minister to marry Amber and Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei). Katherine later decides to take Chancellor Industries public only for her to become the victim of a hostile takeover by Tucker McCall (Stephen Nichols), who is revealed to be her biological son; the child Jill was supposed to be. Despite a rocky relationship, Katherine rushes to Tucker's side when he ends up in a coma and is given control of his company, McCall Unlimited. Katherine is shocked to discover Tucker has been searching for his son, and decides to pick up the search. In the meantime, Katherine stops Tucker's attempt to buy up shares of Victor's company, Newman Enterprises, and even fires his executive, Sofia Winters (Julia Pace Mitchell), and Ashley from Jabot. Tucker recovers and takes back his company while Katherine learns Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), the adopted son of her close friend, Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John), is actually Tucker's son. After Tucker fires Devon from his record label, Katherine launches a label under 'Chancellor Industries and puts Devon in charge. When Tucker steals Jabot out from under Katherine, she has a stroke and the truth about Devon's paternity is revealed. Both father and son are furious with her, but she and Devon eventually begin to work through their differences. When Tucker goes along with another scam allowing everyone to believe Victor is dead, Katherine writes him out of her will and leaves his share to Devon. When Jack takes control of Newman Enterprises and steals Neil away from Chancellor, Katherine comes out of retirement to run her company on her own. Katherine begins suffering from lapses of memory and Jill blames her new assistant, Adriana Stone (Jhoanna Flores). However, it is eventually revealed Katherine has a brain tumor, and Katherine makes Cane keep the secret while she undergoes surgery. The tumor is benign. Katherine steps down as CEO and names Cane as her successor much to Jill's dismay. Cooper's last appearance is Katherine wishing Jill goodnight after a welcome home party. Katherine and Murphy then embark on a three-month-long vacation to several locations where they send postcards to her relatives instructing them to meet her at the mansion on August 16. Jill is shocked to realize the places on the list are on Katherine's bucket list. Murphy returns and tells everyone Katherine died in her sleep following a reunion with Tucker on August 1. Katherine leaves Jill a mysterious letter, while she encourages Nikki to track down the child she gave up as a teenager. After Katherine's funeral, she appears to Jill and Nikki smiling. Katherine instructs her family and friends to celebrate her life, instead of mourning her death. In the meantime, she leaves Devon the remainder of her estate, amounting in $2.45 billion. Reception Katherine is considered a daytime television icon, described as \"the matriarch of all soaps\". Some critics have said that Cooper's performance as Katherine has contributed to the show's success and longevity. HuffPost TV ranked her at number four on \"The 15 Most Memorable Female Soap Opera Characters Ever\", with Michael Maloney writing: In 2022, Charlie Mason from Soaps She Knows named Katherine as the best character on his list of the best 25 characters from The Young and the Restless, commenting \"Who on earth could possibly'' outrank the undisputed king of Genoa City? The late, great Jeanne Cooper's beloved Mommy Warbucks, that’s who. A rare gem, the so-called Duchess was a fabulously flawed individual who was fated to follow her heart… even when that foolish organ convinced her that it was a great idea to drive over a cliff with her estranged husband in tow!\" References The Bold and the Beautiful characters The Young and the Restless characters Television characters introduced in 1973 Fictional business executives Fictional socialites Fictional alcohol abusers Fictional female businesspeople Female characters in television Crossover characters in television Fictional characters incorrectly presumed dead"}

In it, Nando Parrado returns to the events described in Piers Paul Read's 1974 book, Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors which is the story of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, most passengers of which were in a Uruguayan rugby team consisting of alumni of Stella Maris College. The flight crashed into the Andes mountains on October 13, 1972. When what little food they had run out after ten days, those still alive agreed that after their death the others should eat their bodies to survive. Piers Paul Read's version was published two years after the rescue and was based upon interviews with the survivors. Miracle of the Andes, however, is told from Nando Parrado's point of view 34 years later.

The album pays tribute to the pioneers of Surf music like Brian Wilson, Jan and Dean, the Belairs, the Hondells, the Surfaris, the Ventures, Beach Boys, Dick Dale and many others. The album was produced by Terry Scott Taylor who also wrote the majority of the songs which were all recorded exclusively for this album. Nearly every track on the album teams up multiple artists or bands who then join forces to deliver their best tribute to the genre. In some cases, the artists attempt to mix other styles of music with surf music, such as The Insyderz on \"A Good Sailor Knows,\" where the artists attempt to blend their own style of Ska music with Surf. The overall result, according to CCM Magazine, was a sound more like a \"unified record\" than a compilation. In 1999 the album was nominated for the Dove Award in the \"Special Event Album of the Year\" category. The album was dedicated to Carl Wilson.

{"text": "General elections were held in Belize on 21 November 1979. The result was a victory for the ruling People's United Party, which won 13 of the 18 seats. Voter turnout was 89.9%. Background The PUP went into the election with a 13–5 majority, having picked up a seat after the previous election when Toledo District Area Rep. Vicente Choco crossed the floor from the opposition United Democratic Party in 1975. The election results confirmed that 13-5 majority. In 1979, Belizeans were concerned about their progress toward independence and the Guatemalan claim to the colony. The UDP were not in favour of advancing on the former issue without a substantial settlement of the latter, and this led the PUP to turn the election into a sort of referendum on that question. By their turnout (a record high) and their support for the PUP, Belizeans made clear their preferences and set in motion the chain of events that would lead to independence in 1981.

Matson won a silver medal at the 1964 and a gold medal at the 1968 Olympics. Early years The son of Charles and Ellen Matson, Randy Matson was reared in Pampa, the seat of Gray County in the Texas Panhandle. At the age of twelve, he participated in his first track meet. He won the 50-yard dash, the 100-yard dash, the long jump and the high jump and finished sixth in the shot put. He attended Pampa High School, where he was a three-sport standout in American football, basketball, and track and field. He won All-District football honors, and was a two-time All-District and one-time All-State basketball player, averaging 15 points per game. In track and field, he was a two-time State Champion in both the shot put and the discus and could run the 100 yard dash in 10.2 seconds. This led him to be named an All-State and All-American in track and field. He was Track and Field News \"High School Athlete of the Year\" in 1963. Matson was also named Track and Field News' Men's Athlete of the Year in 1970. Amateur career Matson is one of the greatest shot putters in the history of the sport, based predominantly on his one meter improvement of the world record in 1965. He attended Texas A&M University, where he continued to work on his shot put skills, and in his first full year of using the heavier college (adult or Senior) shot (16 pounds), Matson won the Olympic Silver Medal in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. From 1965 through 1971, Matson entered 79 competitions, winning 73. During a two-month span in 1965 he broke the world record three times, adding over two feet to the previous mark, until it stood at . During this time he had a considerable rivalry with Neal Steinhauer, but usually came out on top. Matson earned his BBA in marketing from Texas A&M in 1967. He was selected in the 5th round (120th pick overall) by the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League, and the 11th round (122nd overall) by the Seattle SuperSonics of the National Basketball Association. Matson turned down both opportunities to concentrate on track and field. Matson improved his world record to in 1967, and was rewarded with the James E. Sullivan Award, given to the nation's outstanding amateur athlete. He earned the Olympic Gold Medal at the Mexico City Games in 1968, and was named the 1970 Track and Field News Athlete of the Year. He was on the June 1970 and January 1971 covers of Track and Field News. In 1967 he threw the discus to within three inches (8 cm) of the (then) world record, and was briefly considered as a possible double Olympic champion in shot and discus—like Bud Houser in 1924—but Matson only competed in the shot in Mexico City. On that same day Matson put the shot over 70 feet three times and the discus over 200 feet three times. He narrowly missed making the 1972 Olympic team when he finished fourth at the Olympic Trials. Matson retired after that contest as the only man who, up to that time, had ever put the shot over 70 feet. He was inducted into the Texas A&M Hall of Fame in 1972, the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1974, the National Sports Hall of Fame in 1981, the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1984, the National High School Sports Hall of Fame in 1988 and the Texas Track and Field Coaches Hall of Fame in 2012.

He joined The Association of Former Students in 1972, and served as their executive director from 1979 until his retirement in 1999; he was subsequently honored to be chosen the keynote speaker for the 2000 Aggie Muster held on the A&M campus. In 2003, the Texas A&M Foundation created the post of Senior Philanthropic Officer for him. Once the foundation had completed its One Spirit One Vision fundraising campaign in 2007, far exceeding its goal, Matson announced his resignation. He had suffered from heart trouble in 2004 and wished to spend more time with his six young grandchildren. Matson is married to the former Margaret Burns, a 1966 graduate of Abilene Christian University, where she served as a cheerleader. They have three children, Jessica, who is married to Russell Camp of Amarillo, Jim, and Cole, all of whom graduated from Texas A&M. Matson and his family live in College Station, Texas.

{"text": "Hans Gustav Adolf Gross or Groß (26 December 1847 – 9 December 1915) was an Austrian criminal jurist and criminologist, the \"Founding Father\" of criminal profiling. A criminal jurist, Gross made a mark as the creator of the field of criminality. Throughout his life, Hans Gross made significant contributions to the realm of scientific criminology. As Gross developed in his career as an examining justice, he noticed the failings of the field of law. His book, classes, institutions, and methods helped improve the justice system through his experience as a justice. Early life and career Gross was born on December 26, 1847, in Styria, Austria. As a young adult, Hans Gross graduated in 1870 as a jurist (Examining Justice) from his hometown's university in Upper Styria. His education resulted in two decades of learned knowledge in law. Gross served as the Examining Justice of Styria in which he served as a judge and prosecutor for all crimes presented to him. During his service, he dealt with several fraudulent charges. It was during this job that Gross realized the many shortcomings of the present justice system. Back then, the Examining Justice stood as a criminal investigator. During this time, there were very few crime investigators. Many of the law officers were volunteers or ex-police officers. As a result, jurists mainly solved and prosecuted all crimes brought before them. This proved to be a poor system as many of the magistrates relied on their personal knowledge and limited facts or evidence. This lack of organization led to Gross's active work in criminal science. Academic impact During his life, Gross did much to establish several institutions regarding criminology. Gross mainly did this by reiterating the practice of criminal forensics. He taught and developed several institutions that furthered the influence of the field of criminology. Throughout the years, Gross taught and engaged in constructive debate while professor at Chernivtsi University (1897 to 1902), Prague University (1902 to 1905), and the University of Graz (1905 to 1915). Later in 1898, he established the Institute of Criminology of Graz. In August 1898, he began to teach criminal law in which he presented the field of criminalities. However, many people opposed this idea developing into a study, claiming that it did not serve true beneficial value except to those involved in the justice system. Despite opposing views, Gross established the field of criminalities, branding him forever as the “Founding Father” of criminal profiling. Contributions to criminalistics Gross noticed the faults in the justice system early on in his career. His efforts focused on expanding deep investigation, professional ethics, and the scientific method. He defined criminal psychology from a technical viewpoint, considering it as pure research. Along with studying a person's behaviors, Gross stressed the use of careful judgement due to often misleading evidence. His view of research, technical evidence, and methods also led to the creation of the \"crime scene.\" Relating the concept of the crime scene, Gross explains the necessity of balancing emotion with evidence and evidence with logic. Gross fully introduced the concept of criminalistics in 1893, a period in which the notion of criminology expanded. The concept of criminalistics is divided into two branches: crime and political science. Even though Gross found a new way in which the justice system functioned, many believed the field of criminalistics proved useless, except for examining justices. However, Gross still contributed in furthering criminology for other magistrates in law. He called for the objective use and examination of evidence. He stressed the importance of a judge remaining neutral in cases. He did this, mainly, by presenting new concepts in the examination of crime scenes, such as crime scene photography, fingerprints, microscopy, and X-rays. Criminal Investigations, a Practical Textbook Gross's book was written to cover philosophical and systematic aspects of criminology. In 1893, his book Criminal Investigations, a Practical Textbook (Handbuch für Untersuchungsrichter als System der Kriminalistik) was published. The purpose of the book was to make up for a deficiency in criminalistics. He wrote it as an instructive book, focusing on human nature and the motives of a criminal. He presents his theories through psychological and material elements. Gross especially expanded on body language and the importance of the judge and the witness involved in a criminal case. He observes the behaviors of murderers, arsonists, thieves, and counterfeiters. Gross strongly focuses on the failings and inconsistencies of the judges and witnesses, the importance of materialistic evidence, and relating facts with reason. He believed that the study of psychology allowed one to understand the motives of criminals. Also, he relates chemistry, physics, botany, secret codes, and the use of blood to further determine facts and motives. He believed an overall education in these studies proved beneficial, especially to judges and investigating officers. Summary Hans Gross made his mark in the world as a criminologist. He is associated with being the creator of the field of criminology after establishing the study at the Institute of Criminology in Graz. Throughout his life, he assisted in advancing the crime investigation world, especially in 1893 when the practice of criminology became more widespread. Introducing new investigation and observation techniques, such as crime scene photography and examining fingerprints, changed how the justice system functioned. His book, Handbuch für Untersuchungsrichter als System der Kriminalistik, contains revolutionary methods and ideas that greatly broadened criminal science.

{"text": "A drill stem test (DST) is a procedure for isolating and testing the pressure, permeability and productive capacity of a geological formation during the drilling of a well. The test is an important measurement of pressure behaviour at the drill stem and is a valuable way of obtaining information on the formation fluid and establishing whether a well has found a commercial hydrocarbon reservoir. History Working in El Dorado, Arkansas, in the 1920s, E.C. Johnston and his brother M.O. Johnston developed the first drill stem tester and ran the first commercial drill stem test in 1926. In April 1929, the Johnston Formation Testing Corporation was granted a patent (U.S. Patent 1,709,940) and they subsequently refined the testing system in the early 1930s. In the 1950s, Schlumberger introduced a method for testing formations using wireline. The Schlumberger formation-testing tool, placed in operation in 1953, fired a shaped charge through a rubber pad that had been expanded in the hole until it was securely fixed in the hole at the depth required. Formation fluids flowed through the perforation and connecting tubing into a container housed inside the tool. When filled, the container was closed, sealing the fluid sample at the formation pressure. The tool was then brought to the surface, where the sample could be examined. In 1956, Schlumberger acquired Johnston Testers and continues to perform drill stem tests and wireline formation tests in both open and cased holes. About Drill Stem Testing Drill stem testing is an oil and gas exploration procedure to isolate, stimulate and flow a downhole formation to determine the fluids present and the rate at which they can be produced. The main objective of a DST is to evaluate the commercial viability of a zone's economic potential by identifying productive capacity, pressure, permeability or extent of an oil or gas reservoir. These tests can be performed in both open and cased hole environments and provide exploration teams with valuable information about the nature of the reservoir. Drill stem testing involves deploying a series of tools known as a test bottomhole assembly (BHA). A basic drill stem test BHA consist of a packer or packers, which act as an expanding plug to be used to isolate sections of the well for the testing process, valves that may be opened or closed from the surface during the test, and recorders used to document pressure during the test. In addition to packers a downhole valve is used to open and close the formation to measure reservoir characteristics such as pressure and temperature which are charted on downhole recorders within the BHA. Below are two types of BHA DST, Cased Hole which can be applied after the well has been cased, and Open Hole which may be performed before casing. Applications of drill stem testing Cased Hole stimulation Performed after the well is cased, cased hole drill stem testing uses a retrievable production packer that is set above the zone of interest. The well is then flow tested through perforations in the casing. The two types of cased hole testing are pressure operated and mechanically operated. Open Hole Because it's performed before casing is run, open hole drill stem testing can be the most economical way to determine productive capacity, pressure, permeability or the extent of an oil or gas reservoir. The testing equipment is run into the well and the zone of interest is isolated using inflate or compression-set packers, depending on your requirements and drilling conditions. Alternate Procedures Depending on testing objectives and scope of work, drill stem testing may also be performed in combination with various other exploration and completion process such as fluid loss control and well control, closed chamber tests, well stimulation, and a combination of DST and TCP. Procedure During normal well drilling, drilling mud is pumped through the drill stem and out of the drill bit. In a drill stem test, the drill bit is removed and replaced with the DST tool and devices are inflated above and below the section to be tested. These devices are known as packers and are used to make a seal between the borehole wall and the drill pipe, isolating the region of interest. A valve is opened, reducing the pressure in the drill stem to surface pressure, causing fluid to flow out of the packed-off formation and up to the surface. Results In a low permeability or low pressure formation, surface production may not be achieved but the volume and flow rate of fluid can still be analysed within the drill stem.

{"text": "Adam Ritson (born 6 August 1976) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks and the Parramatta Eels in the New South Wales Rugby League competition in Australia. His position of choice was at prop-forward. Childhood and early career Ritson was born in Sydney, New South Wales. He began playing rugby league at an early age for the Miranda Magpies in the Sutherland Shire and was quickly earmarked as a star player for his advanced skills at such a young age along with his size. He later moved on to rival club the Engadine Dragons before being signed to the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks at an early age. While attending De La Salle in 1993, Ritson was selected to play for the Australian Schoolboys team. Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks His talent was noticed immediately at the Cronulla club impressing coaches at all levels, including first grade coach Arthur Beetson. Beetson immediately drafted Ritson into the Sharks first grade team while he was still only sixteen years of age in 1993, making him one of the youngest ever first grade players. Ritson then went on to make several appearances over the next three seasons for the club. After impressing all with his talent, skill and size at such a young age and appearing in the Sharks Presidents Cup final victory in 1994, as well as tasting his first representative game with the City Origin side, Adam found himself in the middle of a battle for his signature between the Australian Rugby League and Super League competitions. Ritson decided on staying with the Australian Rugby League, essentially meaning he would have to leave his Cronulla club after they had signed on to become a Super League team making himself a free-agent after the 1995 season. After the Super League war had begun on 30 March 1995 with the rebel competition signing a number of teams and players, it was Ritson who inadvertently alerted the ARL to what was happening. Super League were signing Cronulla players following their win over new team the Western Reds in Perth when Ritson, showing maturity belying his 18 years, balked at signing, stating that he wished to speak to his manager and his parents first. Ritson was then allowed to phone his manager back in Sydney to discuss the SL offer. Following this his manager immediately rang the ARL to inform them what was going on. After talking to his manager (as well as seeking advice from his parents) he then signed with the SL, but was given a 24-hour cooling-off period should he wish to back out of the deal. Ritson ultimately did back out of the deal and would eventually sign with the ARL. Parramatta Eels With his signature being chased after by the majority of ARL clubs Ritson eventually agreed to sign for the Parramatta Eels for the start of the 1996 season. Adam was placed into the Eels starting line-up with immediate effect and after playing just eleven games for his new club struck tragedy in a fixture against the Canberra Raiders. Just two minutes into the game he was knocked unconscious after a dangerous high tackle from Canberra forward John Lomax and with the completion of the game and a routine scan it was discovered he had a life-threatening brain cyst. Ritson then went on to have fourteen operations over the next year, several of which nearly left him dead. Eventually he made a full recovery but was never the same and retired from the game later that year at the age of twenty. After his career was effectively over at such a young age, a lawsuit was filed by Ritson first against Lomax for the high tackle, but was then shifted towards his club the Raiders instead. Eventually the case was settled out of court, with Ritson being given a six-figure sum.

{"text": "The Kensico Reservoir is a reservoir spanning the towns of Armonk (North Castle) and Valhalla (Mount Pleasant), New York, located 3 miles (5 km) north of White Plains. It was formed by the original earth and gravel Kensico Dam constructed in 1885, which impounded waters from the Bronx and Byram rivers. In 1917, a new masonry dam was completed, replacing the old dam and expanding the water supply by bringing water from the Catskill Mountains over a distance of more than 100 miles. The reservoir mainly serves to store waters received from the Catskill Mountains west of the Hudson River. Along with the West Branch Reservoir and Boyds Corner Reservoir, it is one of four reservoirs within the Catskill/Delaware system outside the Catskill Mountains region. The other reservoir is the Hillview Reservoir. The Kensico Reservoir also hosts fishing and boating recreation. Every year, the reservoir is stocked with over 2,000 brown trout. In April 2016, the Kensico Reservoir was stocked with 8,620 brown trout long. History As the population of New York City grew in the 19th century, so did the need for water. The first use of water from Westchester County came from the old Croton Dam (forming what was called Croton Lake), which was completed in 1842. In the 1880s, the City faced increasing demands for water and sought to enlarge the Croton Reservoir to meet that need. The enlargement of the Croton Reservoir (with the construction of the New Croton Dam and the forming of the New Croton Reservoir) was completed in 1906 as a part of a system of reservoirs designed to bring water from Putnam and Westchester Counties (the Croton Watershed) to New York City. The village of Kensico, New York, was named in 1849 for a Siwanoy Indian chief, Cokenseko, who had sold most of the land surrounding White Plains to English settlers in the 1600s. In 1885, the old Kensico Dam was built south of the village of Kensico, NY as an additional source of water for New York City. The earth and gravel dam formed a small lake from water supplied by the Bronx River and the Byram River, but it was still not enough for the ever-increasing population of New York City. A reservoir was needed that would contain waters from various new reservoirs and act as a holding tank for distribution to New York City. Kensico was surrounded by hills that came to a natural V-shape, making it an ideal area to hold a vast amount of water. To the south of Kensico was Rye Pond and Little Rye Pond in Harrison, New York, which would eventually form part of the new reservoir. A nearby quarry in Harrison bordering Cranberry Lake, provided the necessary materials for building the new dam. Although Kensico had a population of approximately 200, it was home to churches, hotels and a railroad station. In 1905, legislation was passed by New York State to allow money to be raised for the building of the Kensico Reservoir. The next year, final planning by the state was approved, and preliminary surveys were started. A seventeen-mile railroad spur and small network of highways were privately built to carry materials from quarries at nearby Cranberry and Silver Lakes to the dam site. A camp for the workers and their families was also constructed, along with facilities such as schools for their children. To prepare for the dam construction, each individual lot of land was condemned and appraised, and the owner was paid a \"fair value\" for the land. Many of the families had to move to such surrounding communities as Armonk, Harrison, Valhalla, and White Plains. The village of Kensico was then flooded to make way for the reservoir. After the September 11 attacks, the road spanning the top of the Kensico Dam was closed to all traffic for fear of an attempt to destroy the dam. On September 11, 2005, a 9/11 memorial was dedicated in the dam plaza to the 111 Westchester County residents who died in the attack. In May 2012, the roadway was reopened to pedestrian and bicycle traffic. On July 12, 2018, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) press office announced plans for a Kensico-Eastview Connection Project. The project mainly involves constructing an approximately 2 mile long tunnel between the Kensico Reservoir and the nearby Catskill/Delaware Ultraviolet Light Disinfection (CDUV) Facility. Dam construction Before constructing the existing Kensico Dam, the old Kensico Dam had to be removed; this began in 1911. The construction of the new dam began in 1913 and was concluded in 1917—three years ahead of schedule—at a cost of more than $15,000,000. The dam is 1,843 feet (562 m) long, stands above its foundation, and is able to hold back about of water. It contains of masonry—as much masonry as the Egyptians used to build some of the pyramids. In one month, 2.5 million cubic yards of concrete were placed into block-shaped forms, which had to cure for three months before being swung onto the rising hyperbolic pile of dam. Frank E. Winsor was the engineer in charge of construction at Kensico, as well as the Hillview Reservoir in Yonkers and of the Catskill Aqueduct. New York City's main contractor built a work camp at nearby Valhalla for the 1,500 men who worked on the dam at the height of construction. The water supply board created a mounted police force to keep order. Crews were largely made up of Italian immigrants, who began the long task of digging straight down to a depth of to reach solid rock with no water-bearing seams. This entailed months of blasting and a number of fatal accidents. As the aqueduct neared completion in 1913, the work gangs at Kensico began laying the first of the concrete bricks of which the dam is built. The tremendous influx of workers and their families provided a period of prosperity for the surrounding area, spurring new stores, rooming houses, hotels, restaurants and saloons. Many of the construction families remained in the area after completion of the dam, contributing to the growth and character of Valhalla and its environs. The Kensico Reservoir was acquired as parkland in 1963 from the New York City Watershed Commission and remains the property of the DEP. Kensico Dam Plaza is a Westchester County Park. Water sources The reservoir is the collecting point for the water from all six reservoirs in the Catskill Mountains: the Ashokan Reservoir, the Cannonsville Reservoir, the Neversink Reservoir, the Pepacton Reservoir, the Rondout Reservoir, and the Schoharie Reservoir. It also receives water from the Boyds Corner Reservoir and the West Branch Reservoir through the Delaware aqueduct. Water freely flows between Kensico Reservoir and Rye Lake. Through the use of pumping stations along the Delaware Aqueduct, it is possible to supply Kensico reservoir with water from the Cross River Reservoir and Croton Falls Reservoir (and indirectly, the reservoirs upstream of Croton Falls) as well as the Hudson River, however these connections are normally not in use. The resulting body of water has a drainage basin of only , yet holds of water at full capacity. The reservoir's watershed provides only 2% of NYC's water supply; the rest of the water comes from the reservoirs to which it connects. The water in the reservoir either provides New York City and Westchester County with water, or it travels down the spillway east of the main Kensico Dam, and continues down the rest of the Bronx River, eventually flowing to the East River. There are two outlets which provide water to parts of Westchester County. The water supplying New York City travels down either the Catskill Aqueduct or the Delaware Aqueduct. After leaving Kensico, the water is treated with ultraviolet light at the New York City Department of Environmental Protection's Eastview facility, then continues on to Hillview Reservoir. At Hillview the water enters the three city tunnels which distribute water throughout the boroughs of New York City. Since the opening of the Eastview UV facility the Catskill Aqueduct between Kensico Reservoir and Eastview has been out of service. There is a new tunnel being built replacing the aqueduct on this section, and until its completion, all water must travel via the Delaware Aqueduct between these two points. Dam restoration In 2005, the DEP commenced a $31.4 million project to restore the Kensico Dam. The rehabilitation project consisted of reconstructing the colonnades at the ends of the dam; cleaning and repairing all stone masonry surfaces on the dam; reconstructing the lower pavilions; reconstructing the dam's downstream terrace; reconstructing the spillway and spillway channel; cleaning the spillway discharge pipe; cleaning the internal galleries; installing new lighting and doors; reconstructing the Upper Gate Chamber, Lower Valve Chamber and Maintenance House; and performing grading and landscaping. Fishing Kensico Reservoir sustains an active population of gamefish, supplemented by stocking, including brown trout, lake trout, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, perch, and grass pickerel. The size and depth of the reservoir allow lake trout in particular to thrive. Shore fishing is practiced in many areas, and boating is restricted to Department of Environmental Conservation licensed and inspected aluminum rowboats. No motor-boats are permitted on the reservoir, nor are recreational watercraft such as kayaks, rafts, or canoes. In April 2020, the reservoir was stocked with 7,360 brown trout fingerlings. The reservoir was formerly stocked with lake trout, however, this program was discontinued after it was determined they had established a sustainable breeding population. Kensico Dam Plaza The Kensico Dam plaza is a plaza located at the foot of the dam. Modern use of the plaza is as a public park. Historically, Westchester County's Department of Parks has hosted several community-wide events, including outdoor screenings throughout the summer and early autumn, and a Fourth of July celebration with fireworks, food trucks, and live music. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it also sponsored \"Winter Wonderland,\" a winter-holiday-themed drive-through light experience. The plaza also provides opportunities for recreational activities, including a playground, large lawn, gravel paths for walking and biking, and a hiking trail running from the plaza-level to the top of the dam. Placards posted throughout the plaza encompass its history. In 2014, an electrical system upgrade added permanent park lighting, allowing the plaza to remain open after dark. The plaza is also home to The Rising, a memorial dedicated to victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks who were from Westchester County. This memorial displays the names of the victims on the granite surrounding the main structure. The main structure of the memorial is made of steel rods that come together and point to the sky. Visitors can interact with the memorial by going inside the structure. The Rising is where the annual 9/11 commemoration takes place at Kensico Dam plaza, a ceremony honoring the Westchester residents who lost their lives that day.

{"text": "is a Japanese shōjo manga series written by Tohko Mizuno who also worked on the video game of the same name, which was developed by Ruby Party and published by Koei. The manga was serialized in LaLa DX magazine from July 1999 to January 2010, and published by Hakusensha in 17 volumes. An English version was licensed by Viz Media under the title Haruka: Beyond the Stream of Time. The storyline initially follows the characters and events from the first installment of the video game series. An anime series titled was developed by Yumeta Company with Aki Tsunaki directing, with 26 episodes broadcast from October 5, 2004 to March 29, 2005. The anime received an English dub titled Haruka: Beyond the Stream of Time: A Tale of the Eight Guardians. Setting Although an exact time period is not given for Akane's arrival in Heian Kyou, it seems likely that the story is set in the earlier part of the era, when families such as the Tachibana-ke, Fujiwara-ke and Minamoto-ke were all in some prominence. Though the Fujiwara-ke and Minamoto-ke continued to hold significant position through until the Genpei war, the Tachibana-ke faded out of favor during the 9th and 10th centuries. This suggests that Harukanaru Toki no Naka de is set sometime in the 9th or 10th centuries. This would also fit with later continuations of the Harukanaru Toki no Naka de plot, since Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 2 is set a century later, and features prominently once more the Fujiwara-ke and Minamoto-ke, as well as the Taira-ke. The third installment, Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 3 is set in the period of the Genpei War, which came to an end in 1185. If it can be considered that the third installment is set a century on from the second, this would indicate that the original Harukanaru Toki no Naka de storyline is most probably set in the latter half of the 10th century. Plot On her walk to school, ordinary Kyoto High school student Motomiya Akane hears a voice calling to her from an old well in an abandoned historical estate. The voice is that of the oni leader Akuram, and Akane finds herself summoned into another world that resembles the city of Kyoto during the Heian Period (approx. 800-1200). Here she is asked to be the , a legendary figure who possesses the power of the gods. Akane is told that she must defend this world, called , from the encroachment of the before she can return home. Fortunately, her school friends Tenma and Shimon are on hand to help her out and along with six Kyou natives they become members of the , a group of specially chosen men who act as the Miko's protectors. Characters Main characters A modern high school girl, Akane is transported to the Heian era and recognized as the Ryuujin no Miko, or Priestess of the Dragon God. She carries the power of the Dragon God within her body such that she can purify impurities from contact. Though reluctant to use her powers as priestess, Akane is determined to do the right thing. She is innocent and kindhearted, which sometimes leads her into trouble. The Eight Guardians One of Princess Fuji's bodyguards, who comes to protect Akane as well. He becomes one of the Eight Guardians, as . He is the strong, silent type and will do anything his mistress asks of him. A little bit of a tough guy, Tenma is Akane's close friend from school. He is one of the Eight Guardians, as . He cares deeply for Akane and loves her, but doesn't really show it in the beginning. As the series progresses, he begins to reveal his feelings. He has a sister named Ran, who disappeared under mysterious circumstances. A hotheaded young man whose one goal in life is to destroy demons for ruining his and his sister's lives. He is , one of the Eight Guardians. One of Akane's good friends from school, Shimon is a smart, cute, and very loyal. Along with Akane and Tenma, he is transported to the Heian era. Besides confused as an oni at first, having traits such as blond hair and blue eyes, he is recognized as one of the Eight Guardians, . Hardworking, studious, and chivalrous to all women, Takamichi works in the palace archives in Kyou. He becomes one of the Eight Guardians, as . Tomomasa is a general in Kyou, known for being flirtatious, nonchalant, and popular with the ladies. He is one of the last to become a Guardian, as . Eisen is the younger brother of the current emperor of Kyou. Though he had been eligible to inherit the throne, Eisen gave up his position to become a monk. He is an accomplished musician and is a sweet, thoughtful, timid man. Eisen fell deeply in love with Akane when they first met, and is willing to sacrifice his life for her safety. He is , one of the Eight Guardians. A cool, intense guy and one of the Eight Guardians as , Yasuaki is a gifted apprentice to the famous sorcerer Abe no Seimei. Despite his expressionless exterior, Yasuaki is childlike in the sense he doesn't quite understand emotions; He even shed tears with a blank face when Akane was upset with him on one occasion. He holds Akane with high regard, and develops a certain fondness for her. Oni Clan The leader of the Oni Clan, who summoned Akane to Kyou in order to utilize her power to gain full domination over the city. Akuram is said to be the most powerful of recent leaders of the Oni Clan, and his power stretches to such a level that even his close associates aren't sure how to deal with it. Akuram inherited the mask of the Oni Clan, allowing him to lead them, because he had the greatest potential to do so as a young boy. Even now he is still young despite his position. On one occasion the mask is shattered, breaking his spell and forcing him to retreat, and it seems that the mask itself is a way of focusing the magic of the Oni. Akuram's motivation is not always clear. Sometimes it appears that he simply wants to dominate all of Kyou, however on occasion he suggests that part of his motivation is revenge for the deaths of many of his kinsfolk over the past generations of conflict between the Oni and the people of Kyou. His interest in Akane seems to be predominately a matter of obtaining power, although he often refers to her as 'his' Miko, and gets quite angry when any of his subordinates bring harm to her without his permission. Ikutidaru is Akuram's right hand man and probably the oldest of the surviving oni. Of all of the oni clan he has the greatest sense of conscience, and is often torn between his loyalty to his people and his love for Inori's older sister Seri. In the anime, he once disobeyed Akuram and had his eye removed as punishment for the crime (although in the manga it is not yet explained how he came to lose his eye). Despite the fact he does not always agree with the things Akuram orders, he often carries them out with resolute seriousness, even though at times it makes Kyou's predicament worse. He has a strongly protective - almost paternal - instinct where Sefuru is concerned (although Sefuru is rarely appreciative of that fact). In the manga, Ikutidaru is currently working with Akane and Yorihisa against Akuram as they try to break the curse Akuram has placed over them. His defection was inspired largely by the way in which Sefuru was injured by Akuram when he was discarded. The only female among the surviving members of the Oni Clan, Shirin holds a strong affection for Akuram which will allow her to do pretty much anything he tells her to do. She is very jealous of Akane because of Akuram's interest in her, and on one occasion goes behind Akuram's back and assaults the Miko because of this jealousy. Akuram seems to have no affection for her, discarding her from the clan towards the end, however in the anime conclusion Shirin offers to exchange her life for Akane's in order to be with Akuram in the afterlife. Although this ending only occurred in the anime, not in the manga. Shirin's key power is the ability to use her beauty to seduce and then manipulate the actions of men, and therefore she is angered by Takamichi who refuses to submit to her seduction spell. She and Takamichi maintain a chemistry throughout the story on account of this, with Takamichi once saving her life despite her attempts to kill him. Shirin's physical attacks often involve a rose, whose vines and thorns she can manipulate at will. Sefuru is the youngest surviving Oni, probably no more than fourteen or fifteen years old. He is technically half and half, since his mother was a normal resident of Kyou. Sefuru is bitter and hates the people of Kyou because his mother abandoned him based on his appearance when he was just a small child. It was at this time that Akuram took him in and began to train him to use him for his own purpose. For this reason, despite his half blood, Sefuru has been accepted as an Oni by the rest of the clan. However, he has a deep rooted fear of being abandoned and alone again, which often drives him to desperate acts. At one point he befriends Shimon, thinking that he's an Oni in the same situation, though he becomes indignant when he thinks that Shimon has betrayed the Oni by joining up with people in the city and is even more perturbed when he discovers that Shimon is one of the Hachiyou. Despite his aggression, however, Shimon is sure that Sefuru is more hurt than anyone by the encounter, and refuses to bear him a grudge. In the end, Sefuru is shown with Ikutidaru, Seri and their new baby, indicating that his hatred is based in his loneliness, and all he really needed was a proper place to belong. In the manga, Sefuru is discarded by Akuram and taken in while in his injured state by Inori's sister Seri on Ikutidaru's request. Technically not a blood member of the oni clan, Ran is actually Tenma's long lost sister from modern day Kyouto. She was summoned into Kyou by Akuram some time earlier, but was too frightened to be able to connect with Ryuujin and become Ryuujin no Miko. In her despair, she reached out instead to the black dragon and became engulfed by its power, erasing her memories of her past life and putting her under Akuram's control. Ran continues to battle with her alter-ego throughout both manga and anime, though perhaps more significantly in the manga. Probably on account of her association with the oni clan, Ran's name is also occasionally written in Katakana as 「ラン」 and features this way on the anime credits. However, in the manga it is given in kanji, as shown above. Other characters The descendant of the who assists the Ryūjin no Miko. She looks very young, and is in fact only ten years old, but she's also very wise for her age. She is the daughter of the Minister of the Left, an important ranking figure at the imperial court, and therefore speaks very formally at all times. The 'hime' in her name indicates that she is the daughter of a wealthy and influential individual. She is the first person Akane meets when she enters Kyou, appearing as she does in the Star Clan's mansion house. Kotengu (literally, \"little tengu\") is the nickname given to the Tengu of , one of the northern mountains around Kyou. Although originally a fearsome creature, Kotengu's power was sealed by Yasuaki and he was confined to a miniature form in which he could not do any magic (but plenty of eating and complaining). He is semi-adopted by Akane and the Hachiyou and although he is constantly threatening revenge against Yasuaki, he settles down to often run errands for the group. In the anime, Kotengu's magic is unsealed by Yasuaki to let him fight against the possessed Byakko, and though defeated, he survives the encounter and returns to his miniature form at the end of the series. In the manga, his fate is more decisive. It appears that he was killed after a similar battle with Ikutidaru, in which Eisen mistakenly prevented Kotengu from attacking the oni, therefore leaving him defenseless. Inori's sister, who is in love with Ikutidaru despite knowing that he is a member of the oni tribe. Seri is weak physically, but mentally very strong. It is hinted (though not openly said) at several points in the anime that Seri is pregnant with Ikutidaru's child - and at the close of the anime it is shown that they have a newborn baby. In the manga, Seri is shown as a very sympathetic person who, despite her own weak health, has been secretly nursing the injured Sefuru on Ikutidaru's request. Eisen's older brother and the current ruler of Kyou. A well-reasoned man, the Emperor is usually calm and composed even in the face of his subjects' panic about the future of the city. Although his position means that certain formalities must be observed, the Emperor is very close to his young brother and seeks to protect him, as he feels it's somewhat his fault that Eisen has been driven to hide himself in a religious life. He is also close friends with Tomomasa as far as their difference in status allows, and occasionally they can be found sharing a joke at Eisen's expense. Though he takes an active interest in Ryuujin no Miko's progress, the Emperor is entirely detached from her activities and often wishes he could be more involved in saving his people from harm. His name is never given - and even by Eisen he is only referred to as either 'okami' (a formal manner of addressing a King) or 'aniue' (a polite term for older brother). Other cast members refer to him as 'mikado' or 'okami'. Yorihisa's elder brother, who is deceased by the time Akane arrives in Kyou. There is a significant age gap between Yorihisa and Sanehisa and it appears that Sanehisa was largely involved in Yorihisa's training and his upbringing. The way in which Sanehisa's role in proceedings is portrayed varies from anime to manga, although he appears in flashback quite often when a situation relates closely to Yorihisa (for example his memories of the Nue). In the anime, Yorihisa and Tenma both receive a brief dream message from Sanehisa telling them to go East to find the Eastern Seal. This is then followed by a scenario surreally sinister to the events that led up to Sanehisa's death, for which Yorihisa holds himself responsible. By defending Tenma in a similar way to how Sanehisa defended him, Yorihisa feels he has somewhat 'atoned' and can at last share the story with his companions (Akane and later Tenma). In the manga, Yorihisa is afraid to face Sanehisa and receive the dream message because he feels to blame for Sanehisa's death, which is recounted as happening the same way as the anime depicts. Unlike Yorihisa, who is generally quite serious and focused in how he deals with situations, Sanehisa is a lot more light-hearted and is willing to tease both Akane and Yorihisa in the manga when he visits them in dreams. It is clear that he and Yorihisa shared a close bond and that he does not hold his brother responsible for his death - rather he sacrificed his life to ensure that Yorihisa survived. Though Sanehisa's name appears briefly in the anime, it is screamed rather than spoken, thus causing it to have been mis-heard and mis-written as a result. However on both anime credits and in the manga it is written as above, with the reading as given. Media Manga The manga was done by Mizuno. It was serialized in LaLa DX magazine from July 1999 to January 2010, and published by Hakusensha in 17 volumes.

{"text": "In modern usage, an aquamanile (plural aquamanilia or simply aquamaniles) is a ewer or jug-type vessel in the form of one or more animal or human figures. It usually contained water for the washing of hands (aqua + manos) over a basin, which was part of both upper-class meals and the Christian Eucharist. Historically (since the 6th century) the term was used for a basin used for priest's ablutions. The water was supplied by a subdeacon, and aquamanile was a symbol of subdeaconate. The term was later transferred onto secular ewers. Most surviving examples are in metal, typically copper alloys (brass or bronze), as pottery versions have rarely survived. Islamic art Persian aquamaniles predate any zoomorphic aquamaniles known in Europe. An Iranian (Abbasid caliphate), aquamanile in the form of an eagle, bearing the date 180 AH/CE 796-797 is the earliest dated Islamic object in metalwork. It is cast in bronze, inlaid with silver and copper, and can be found in the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia. The city of origin is unknown, as the inscription allows for a variety of interpretations. However, it is theorized that it was made in Iraq or Syria, due to the elaborate technique of decorative inlays that would only have been known to those areas at the time. It is possible that at one point, it was used as a weathervane, due to a hole between the feet; however, this has not been confirmed. Among the latest in date is one also at the Hermitage, an Islamic aquamanile depicting a zebu and calf, from Khorasan dated 1206. This object is also a rare example of an Islamic automaton, as the (now lost) harness and bridle were movable, as well as the tail, and the bell wrapped around its neck would have rung when poured. The symbolism of the young lion on the top of the aquamanile has been subject to academic debate, due to academic disagreement as to whether the lion is attacking the zebu or suckling on its back. However, some suggest that it is a depiction of the young mythological king Fereydun and represents his slow ascent to kingship from his humble beginnings as a cattle breeder. While Islamic law forbids the use of animal depictions in religious settings, and few examples of Islamic aquamaniles survive, it is believed that they were used to a great extent in the Islamic world. The inscription on the zebu and calf from Khorasan states that it was \"cast in one,\" or, in other words, was cast using the lost-wax casting process. The complexity of the piece suggests that the artisans involved had accomplished such a technical feat many times before. Aquamanilia were often commissioned by the emerging Islamic upper middle class as a display of wealth. Despite their uniqueness and rarity, Islamic aquamanilia are understudied. Europe The Byzantine Empire's cultural connections with Sassanid Persia and the Abbasid caliphate, never peaceful in the political sphere, nevertheless brought the aquamanile into the Christian Mediterranean world. The earliest European portable aquamaniles date to the eleventh century. Ewers and basins were needed in Christian liturgy for the ritual of the lavabo, in which the officiating priest washes his hands before vesting, again before the consecration of the Eucharist and after mass. As a ritual object, metal was considered more suitable than pottery, although most examples in pottery no doubt were broken and discarded. The aquamaniles made in the Mosan – or Meuse valley – region, using the brass alloy of silvery tint called dinanderie (from the center of its manufacture in the region of Dinant) were often fantastic and zoomorphic in their forms, which were constrained only by the need for a larger opening for filling the vessel and a spout for pouring. Church records inventory aquamaniles in silver or gilt copper, but the great majority of surviving examples are in base metals, which were not worth melting down. As well as the altar, aquamaniles were used at the tables of the great, where extravagant designs of symbolic or fantastical beasts – lions were especially popular – were developed in purely secular iconography. A gold aquamanile, c. 1215, in the treasury of the cathedral at Aachen, takes the form of a man's bust; it is a rare survival of an aquamanile in a precious metal. An aquamanile (ref. Metropolitan Museum) in the form of Aristotle on hands and knees, being ridden by Phyllis, bore several moral lessons, with ribald undertones; such an aquamanile was distinctly secular in nature. Bronze aquamaniles in the form of leopards were part of court ritual in Benin, where the concept may have arrived from the Islamic north. An 18th-century bronze leopard aquamanile from Benin is in the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. From the Renaissance elaborate versions of the conventional ewer were preferred to zoomorphic forms. A late version of the aquamanile was the silver-gilt mounted rider on a stand, bought in 1700 for the treasury of the Basilica of St-Denis and sold in 1798. Its form is recorded in an engraving by Félibien. (ref. St-Denis) The idea of ewers in fantastic shapes has never died out.

The song was the first entry ever to mention the contest by name as part of what is generally agreed to have been a send-up of the whole event (previous entries such as Schmetterlinge's \"Boom Boom Boomerang\" had parodied the contest without actually naming it).

{"text": "In trust law, a settlor is a person who settles (i.e. gives into trust) their property for the benefit of the beneficiary. In some legal systems, a settlor is also referred to as a trustor, or occasionally, a grantor or donor. Where the trust is a testamentary trust, the settlor is usually referred to as the testator. The settlor may also be the trustee of the trust (where he declares that he holds his own property on trusts) or a third party may be the trustee (where he transfers the property to the trustee on trusts). In the common law of England and Wales, it has been held, controversially, that where a trustee declares an intention to transfer trust property to a trust of which he is one of several trustees, that is a valid settlement notwithstanding the property is not vested in the other trustees. Capacity to be a trustee is generally co-extensive with the ability to hold and dispose of a legal or beneficial interest in property. In practice, special considerations arise only with respect to minors and mentally incapacitated persons. A settlor may create a trust by manifesting an intention to create it. In most countries no formalities are required to create an trust over personal property, but there are often formalities associated with trusts over real property, or testamentary trusts. The words or acts of the settlor must be sufficient to establish an intention that either another person or the settlor himself shall be trustee of the property on behalf of the beneficiary; a general intention to benefit another person on its own is sufficient. These formalities apply to express trusts only, and not to resulting, implied or constructive trusts. For a settlor to validly create a trust, in most common law legal systems they must satisfy the three certainties, established in Knight v Knight: certainty of intention – whether the settlor (or testator) has manifested an intention to create a trust. certainty of subject matter – whether the property identified as being settled is sufficiently accurately identified. certainty of objects – the beneficiaries must be clearly ascertainable within the perpetuity period. Where a settlement of property on a third party trustee by a settlor fails, the property is usually said to be held on resulting trusts for the settlor. However, if a settlor validly transfers property to a third party, and the words used are held not to create a trust, the usual rule is that the donee takes the property absolutely.

{"text": "KIOA (93.3 FM) is a commercial radio station in Des Moines, Iowa. It is owned by Saga Communications, operating as part of its Des Moines Radio Group, and airs a classic hits radio format. The station's studios are located at 1416 Locust Street along with Saga's other Des Moines stations (KSTZ, KAZR, KOEZ, KRNT and KPSZ). The transmitter is located off 24th Street SE, near 6th Avenue SE, in Altoona. KIOA broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. Its HD2 subchannel carries a Top 40 (CHR) format branded as \"Hits 99.9\", which is also heard on 250–watt FM translator station 99.9 K260AM in Des Moines. History KWDM The 93.3 frequency got its start on September 18, 1964 as KWDM. George Webber, who was the founder of the original KWDM (1150 AM, later KWKY), brought back his unique programming after having sold the AM station in 1959 to the 3M Corporation. The FM station consisted of block programming of music, including classical, operatic and ethnic music not heard elsewhere in Des Moines. The schedule also included a weekday talk show, \"Listen While You Work,\" hosted by his wife, Edith Dunham Webber, and Drake University and high school sports. The station had a huge record library of rare classical and operatic albums. KWDM, located at University Avenue, was never a top performer in the ratings, but it did have a loyal following. Unfortunately, that following was not enough to keep it profitable. In 1968, George Webber sold KWDM to a local group known as the SEQ Corporation. The studios were moved to the Mike Wilson building at 4111 Hubbell Avenue, on the east side of Des Moines. The format went from talk to rock and roll to country music. A controversial talk show, the \"Hawkeye Nightline,\" with Russ Lavine, aired Monday-Saturday nights, previously heard on KDMI (97.3 FM, now KHKI). On Sunday nights, John Birch Society members Jim and Mary Parker hosted that three-hour slot. Country disc jockeys included Bob Neel, Jack Myer and Rex Youngs. National news from the ABC FM Network aired 15 minutes after the hour. On April 10, 1969, the station went dark, after the owners of the tower and transmitter site, John and Jean Murphy, shut down the station due to non-payment of rent. A month later, Webber regained control of the station, operating it at reduced hours. In May 1969, the final selection was played, Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\" ballet. Although Webber wanted to bring back the fine music format, he lacked the finances and was too far advanced in his years to make a go of it. The 93.3 frequency went dark for two years until 1971. Top 40 KYNA In 1971, the 93.3 frequency came back on the air as KYNA, airing a Top 40 format, competing against the well established KIOA (940 AM, later KPSZ). Although KYNA was programmed well—including the syndicated American Top 40 program with Casey Kasem—and had high-quality DJs, many homes and cars did not have FM radios in the early 1970s. KYNA lasted for only about a year when it was sold to the owners of its Top 40 competition, KIOA. Oldies KIOA-FM In 1972, KYNA was bought by the Mid-America Broadcasting Company. Eventually, the call sign was changed to KIOA-FM, and the station became \"Solid Gold Oldies, KIOA-FM 93.3\". From 6 a.m. until 6 p.m., the station aired a 1950s oldies format, and simulcasted 940 AM during the remainder of the day. Once again, it was hard to establish a listener base on FM radio in the 1970s, so KIOA-FM also struggled in the ratings. In the early 1970s, KIOA-FM put together a double album of oldies, called \"Solid Gold.\" It contained 24 hits and had a board game on the inside of the cover. These collectible records are rare and hard to find. The records were made to help improve KIOA-FM's popularity and bring in some extra cash flow as well. Magic 93 KMGK In 1976, the station flipped back to Top 40, this time as \"Magic 93\"; with it, the call letters changed to KMGK. This was the most successful format to date on the frequency, as the station pulled in good ratings through the late 70s and early 80s. By the mid-80s, KMGK found itself fighting for market share as KRNQ, KCCQ, and KLYF began also playing hit music on FM radio. KMGK slipped below both of its competitors, and management decided a new format was needed. Country and Rock hits An FM station, KJJY, was taking some of the country music audience of KSO's. It seemed like it might be a good idea for 93.3 to also switch to country as it had a stronger signal than KJJY. The owner, Midwest Communications, promoted the change to \"Hot Country Hits, K93FM.\" Midwest kept the KMGK call letters for about two years. In March 1986, the station rebranded as KKXI, but it failed to advance in the ratings. On August 1, 1986, the station switched back to Top 40 for a third time as \"Z93\" KDWZ, this time using a rock-leaning direction while avoiding titles that sounded Rhythmic or Dance oriented. Competing head-on with the better established KRNQ, KCCQ, and KLYF once again was not easy. Return to Oldies, evolution to Classic hits On October 1, 1990, KDWZ returned to oldies by once again simulcasting KIOA (AM)'s oldies format as \"All Oldies KIOA\", along with a callsign change back to KIOA-FM. In 1993, Saga Communications purchased KIOA-AM-FM from Midwest Communications of Iowa, as the simulcast continued, but the branding switched to \"Oldies 93.3 KIOA.\" Over time, KIOA-FM's listener base grew and the station became one of the most successful in the Des Moines area. On November 18, 1996, the simulcast ended, with the AM becoming \"Talk 940 KXTK\". The call letters then reverted to just KIOA, with the \"-FM\" suffix dropped. In September 2008, the 1960s music was dropped and KIOA evolved into a classic hits format. In addition, the station dropped the \"Oldies 93.3\" moniker in favor of branding by the KIOA call letters, and changed slogans to \"Iowa's Greatest Hits\", with KIOA's playlist primarily focusing on the music of the 1970s and 1980s. KIOA's playlist features music from the 1970s and 1980s, with some 1990s tracks being played. Air-staff changes On July 31, 2007, Saga Communications announced that it would not be renewing the contract of longtime KIOA morning program co-host, Polly Carver-Kimm. Carver-Kimm had been part of \"Maxwell and Polly in the Morning,\" and had also been news director for Saga's other five Des Moines radio stations. Also in July 2007, Dic Youngs, also known as \"Youngsy,\" announced that he would be retiring from KIOA. He told a local newspaper that it was not his choice to retire. Youngs had been with KIOA, both AM and FM, for over 40 years, often talking about old-times and playing 45 RPM records on air. Youngs retired from KIOA on his 66th birthday on September 30, 2007. He would move to sister station KRNT on a part-time basis. Youngs remained at KRNT until his death on October 1, 2009, at age 68. On July 23, 2008, KIOA announced the addition of former Des Moines morning personality Pam Dixon to the KIOA morning show, joining longtime morning host Maxwell Schaffer. Dixon said, \"I feel like the stars have aligned and it was the right time for me to return to broadcasting. I've been a fan of KIOA my whole life and it's MY music.\" A Des Moines native and Hoover High graduate, Dixon attended the University of Iowa. She was first heard on KRNT and Q-102 before beginning a 10-year run on KLYF which ended in 1996. Dixon would retire in April 2017. Amy Sweet, who had been heard on sister station KAZR, would join the morning show in 2014. In May 2018, Schaffer left the station after 23 years; he was replaced in July by Luke Matthews. Sweet was let go in January 2020 due to corporate layoffs, and would be succeeded by Heather McGregor. Jeriney, formerly of KRBZ Kansas City, replaced McGregor as Matthews' co-host in January 2022.

Principles of operation H-TCP is a loss-based algorithm, using additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) to control TCP's congestion window. It is one of many TCP congestion avoidance algorithms which seeks to increase the aggressiveness of TCP on high bandwidth-delay product (BDP) paths, while maintaining \"TCP friendliness\" for small BDP paths. H-TCP increases its aggressiveness (in particular, the rate of additive increase) as the time since the previous loss increases. This avoids the problem encountered by HSTCP and BIC TCP of making flows more aggressive if their windows are already large. Thus, new flows can be expected to converge to fairness faster under HTCP than HSTCP and BIC TCP. Strengths and weaknesses A side effect of increasing the rate of increase as the time since the last packet loss increases, is that flows which happen not to lose a packet when other flows do, can then take an unfair portion of the bandwidth. Techniques to overcome this are currently in the research phase. The Linux implementation of H-TCP also has an option for avoiding \"RTT unfairness\", which occurs in TCP Reno, but is a particular problem for most high speed variants of TCP (although not FAST TCP). Name The algorithm was initially introduced as H-TCP, without mention of what the 'H' stands for. However, it is often called \"Hamilton TCP\", for the Hamilton Institute where it was created.

{"text": "Chipstead is a predominantly commuter village in north-east Surrey, England, that has been a small ecclesiastical parish since the Domesday Survey of 1086. Its rolling landscape meant that Chipstead's development was late and restricted compared to parishes of comparable distance from London. Formerly and formally including Hooley and Netherne-on-the-Hill, on census day, 1831 Chipstead had 66 homes. Today, excluding those two parts, the village has 1,212 homes spread across the slopes and crests of a northern section of the North Downs. Parts of the village are in or adjoin the Surrey Hills AONB. Geography The land within and to all sides forms curved valleys of downland. Beyond Chipstead's boundaries are the villages of Woodmansterne and slightly more distant Coulsdon, Banstead, Hooley and Kingswood. Woodmansterne is in two parts, one of which is in Greater London (as is Coulsdon) – the nearest, the Surrey part is the western follow-on to the built-up valley street of Chipstead. Housing and parks span the east slopes of a narrow valley known as Chipstead Valley or Chipstead Bottom which is a dry valley. This has some subterranean flows common in the chalk hills of the North Downs, a long hill range south of Woking, Croydon and the Thames Estuary. Conservation The residents of Chipstead have prevented installation of street lighting, particularly in the southern parts of the village. Two residents associations exist, both founded in the 20th century. One caters broadly for all parts from Chipstead Valley to Hooley, while the second concentrates on architectural beauty and views from public places in areas where these may be at risk. Identified as among Chipstead's characteristics are its mature trees, hedgerows, rural wildlife and dark skies at night: Chipstead Downs is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). To the north-west of the village is Banstead Heath, a rolling plateau of open common land. This area is maintained by the Banstead Commons Conservators. Today Chipstead does not have a clearly defined village centre; instead there are several small areas of economic activity in a largely residential area. The village is home to many societies, some of which are linked to the church. Another focal point of the village is a small parade of shops, near to the railway station. History The village lay within the Reigate hundred. Chipstead appears in Domesday Book as Tepestede. It was held by William de Wateville. Its Domesday assets were: 3 hides; 7 ploughs, 1 mill worth £1, woodland worth 5 hogs. It rendered £8. The Grade I listed church of St Margaret is in Hooley, the official hamlet of the village, with somewhat isolated geography and its own article. It was restored in 1827 when its patron was the Jolliffe family of Chipstead Court keeping its 12th century arch and foundations. The school in the Victorian era here was endowed by Mary Stephens in 1746 with land producing £70 per annum. Sir Edward Banks (builder) enterprising building contractor for public works, was in 1835 buried in the churchyard – his business partner and daughter's husband being the patrons of the church and owners of Chipstead Court since 1788. From 1894 until 1934 Chipstead was part of Reigate Rural District. Demography The current three-member electoral ward Chipstead, Hooley and Woodmansterne had a population of 6,912 as at the United Kingdom 2011 Census. The census areas which Chipstead occupied were drawn as Reigate and Banstead 004C and 004D. As such, Chipstead has 7.4% of the borough's area and has 2.3% of borough's population. Less than a third of the borough's own proportion of dwelling types, 8% of Chipstead homes were flats or apartments. In total 380 Chipstead residents, 24% of the population in 2011, were retired. Further common comparators for places in the United Kingdom are as shown below. Sport and leisure Within the vicinity of Chipstead, there are several sports clubs, many taking the Chipstead name. Chipstead F.C. a Non-League football club has a minor claim to fame as some of Footballers' Wives was filmed here. Chipstead Rugby Football Club. They play in Surrey League 1 and were founded in 1959. Transport Chipstead railway station is on the Tattenham Corner Line. There are no bus services through the village – route 166, run by Arriva London for London Buses, passes its suburban northern edge to serve neighbouring Woodmansterne. Route 405 passes through Hooley, a short walk from the church. Other services are at Banstead and Coulsdon. Notable persons Actress June Brown lived in Chipstead. The poet Catherine Maria Fanshawe (1765–1834) was born at Shabden in Chipstead. Professional golfer Charles Mayo lived there in 1906. Former footballer Danny Murphy and his actress wife Joanna Taylor are residents of Chipstead. Singer-songwriter David Wiffen spent his early childhood in Chipstead.

{"text": "Chipstead is a small village within the parish of Chevening in the Sevenoaks District of Kent, England. It lies just west of the town of Sevenoaks and just off the A21 and A25 roads. It is also within a short distance of the M25 motorway, though not visible from it. Although small in size, it has various attractions and features, including traditional southern English village architecture and a large lake. The village has two public houses: the \"George and Dragon\", a 16th-century coaching inn on the High Street, and the \"Bricklayers Arms\" on Chevening Road opposite the lake. Chipstead Lake (also known as Longford Lake) is man-made, the result of gravel extraction during the 20th century. It has an area of 30 hectares (74 acres) and is used for: angling by Homesdale Angling Society sailing by Chipstead Sailing Club The Chapel of the Good Shepherd is an Anglican chapel of ease to Chevening parish church. A 19th-century Grade II-listed former chapel (now a house) in the village centre was used by the Bible Christian Church. Chipstead was served by Chevening Halt railway station on the Westerham Valley Branch Line running between Westerham and Dunton Green; it opened in 1881 and closed in 1961. The closest railway station is now Sevenoaks. Chipstead village is now served by the 401 Sevenoaks-Westerham bus and the 452 Sevenoaks Station Circular commuter bus. Chipstead is a comfortable, quiet community. There is a thriving residents' association, which has voiced opinions over issues such as traffic control in the area.

{"text": "Sergeant Alexander Joseph Foley (February 19, 1866 – January 14, 1910) was a member of the United States Marine Corps who was awarded the United States' highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, for having distinguished himself during the Boxer Rebellion. Early years Foley was born in Heckscherville, Pennsylvania to Irish immigrants, Edward and Catherine McDonald Foley. At a young age he decided that he was not going to work the coal mines as his father had done. He joined the United States Marine Corps in 1888 for a period of five years. In 1893, he re-enlisted and, in 1898, he was sent to Cuba during the Spanish–American War where he received his first taste of military action. He also participated in the Philippines Campaign. Boxer Rebellion In 1900, members of a Chinese nationalist society, known as the Righteous Harmony Society or in contemporary English parlance, \"Boxers\", resented the presence of Western foreigners and Chinese Christians on their soil and proceeded to attack them. This became known as the Boxer Rebellion. Hundreds of foreigners were murdered. The British Legation at Peking was under siege for two months and soon after the international settlement at Tientsin was also placed under siege by the Boxers. The small garrison of Marines stationed in Tientsin found themselves under attack and outnumbered by the nationalists, who were determined to \"drive the foreign devils\" out. A multinational military force from the Eight-Nation Alliance whose members were Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States and consisting of 50,000 troops were sent to Tientsin to reinforce the troops already there. On June 21, 1900, the Boxers were entrenched on the outskirts of Tientsin. On July 13, 1900, a major skirmish occurred between Foley's unit, the Ninth U.S. Infantry, and the Boxers. Major James Regan was badly wounded and Foley together with Sergeant Clarence Edwin Sutton and two other Marines, under enemy fire and in total disregard for their own personal safety, rescued the Major. They were able to take Maj Regan to a field hospital three miles away from the location where he was wounded. In the letter which Major Regan wrote recommending the Medal of Honor, he stated the following: After serving in the Boxer Rebellion, Foley was sent to the Marine garrison located in Cavite, in the Philippine Islands. There, on May 11, 1902, in the presence of his unit, he was bestowed with the Medal of Honor. Sergeant Sutton and the two other Marines were also awarded the Medal of Honor. Medal of Honor citation Puerto Rico Foley was reassigned to the Culebra Naval Station located on the island of Culebra, Puerto Rico. On January 14, 1910, Sgt. Alexander J. Foley suffered a heart attack and died at the age of 44. The Department of the Navy did not consider it practical at that time to transfer his body to his hometown, therefore Foley was buried in the municipal cemetery of Culebra, with flags at half mast and with full military honors.

{"text": "Fighter & Attacker is a 1992 vertical-scrolling shooter arcade game developed and published by Namco. Gameplay In Fighter & Attacker, players control one of sixteen different aircraft as they must complete each of the game's eight areas. Each aircraft are based on real-world fighter jets, including the F/A-18E, F-15J, F-117A, and F-14D. They also have their own unique weapon loadout and playstyles; some are slower but fire more destructive shots, while other are much faster but fire weaker shots. There are no power-ups or screen-clearing bombs. Players also have a heath meter that can sustain three hits before being destroyed. Similar to the Xevious series, the player can launch powerful bombs towards ground targets to destroy them. Some enemies will leave behind captured prisoners when destroyed, which can be picked up for additional points. A boss must be defeated at the end of each level, which increase in difficulty and have more sporadic movement patterns as the player progresses. Development Known as F/A in Japan, Fighter & Attacker was programmed for the Namco NA-1 arcade board, which supported titles such as Tinkle Pit and Cosmo Gang the Puzzle. The game is notable for its soundtrack, which was composed jointly by Shinji Hosoe and Takayuki Aihara. During production, Namco executives requested that the music be diverse and not sound similar to that in other games of its kind from the time. Hosoe went with a mixture of techno and rave, which for the genre was unheard of during its release. Namco demonstrated Fighter & Attacker at the 1992 Amusement Machine Show exposition in Japan, shown alongside Final Lap 3 and Bubble Trouble: Golly! Ghost 2. It was published in both Japan and North America in October of that year. Reception The arcade magazine Game Machine claims that Fighter & Attacker was the seventh most-popular arcade game of November 1992 in Japan. Retro Gamer compared its gameplay to Namco's own Xevious for its usage of air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons, and believed fans of the 1942 and Aero Fighters series would likely be invested in it. The magazine felt overall that Fighter & Attacker was a decent scrolling shooter, but its \"bland\" graphical style and setting caused it to be overshadowed by other similar games, and was unsurprised at the lack of a home conversion. Hardcore Gaming 101 writer Neil Foster agreed, believing the game's main fault lied in its lack of a hook: \"The no-frills militant visuals lacks a fantastical and inviting thrill, leaving this fighter stuck on the runway.\" Foster believed the game was graphically behind from other shooters, with uninteresting and generic level environments, and that its difficulty was too high. Though he enjoyed its techno-infused soundtrack, Foster stated that Fighter & Attacker was missing the same level of polish that other military-themed shooters had, such as Aero Fighters.

{"text": "is a first-person racing/shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1993; it ran on Namco System 2 hardware. Gameplay The first player's character, \"Lucky\", a sophisticated man in a business suit, has to both drive by means of a steering wheel and accelerator pedal, and shoot using the first light gun; however, the second player's character, \"Wild\", a surfer with long blond hair, needs to assist in the pursuit with the second light gun. The players must help Lucky and Wild catch six wanted suspects (\"Jerky\", \"Gambit\", \"Juliora\", \"Keel\", \"Bear\", and \"Big Cigar\" himself). As they pursue the suspect for every stage, Lucky and Wild must fire at enemy cars, and shoot down enemies in sight, along with any projectiles fired at them, and obstacles that block them. When they catch up with the suspect, they must continuously fire upon their car until its energy is depleted; if they succeed in doing so, they will have captured the suspect and will receive a reward, but if the stage's timer runs out, the suspect will escape (indicated by the text of \"got away\" appearing on the screen). After each stage, Lucky and Wild shall drive onto the \"Pink Cats Garage\" to get their car repaired for the next stage, where they will be \"entertained\" by young women wearing cats' tails and ears. The game ends when all six stages are cleared, regardless of how many suspects have been captured. There are also five different ways to play the game: one player driving and shooting with another player shooting, but also one player driving with another player manning the gun, one player driving with another player manning both guns, one player driving, another player manning one gun and a third player manning the second gun, and one single player manning both guns while driving (unofficial), for Namco never manufactured a game that allowed a maximum of three players to play simultaneously. Development Lucky & Wild was the creation of Yutaka Kounoe, a video game designer who joined Namco in 1991. His first project was Tank Force, an arcade sequel to Tank Battalion, later working on the original Point Blank and the Time Crisis series. The company's planning department looked at the arcade industry and noticed that Japanese video arcades were primarily populated by young couples; Namco and Kounoe decided on making a large-scale arcade machine that could be enjoyed by these couples, primarily men. Looking for inspiration, Kounoe noticed the surge in popularity of buddy-cop movies in Japan, such as CHiPS and Police Story; he decided to make the game a homage to these films, as he felt it would make it easy for players to become engaged with a familiar setting. CHiPS was also the source of inspiration for the game's title, as in Japan it was called Joe & Ponch. With an idea in place, Kounoe and the development team began production on Lucky & Wild. Early designs for the game took cues from Sega's Rail Chase, specifically its motion-based seat that reacted based on the player's actions in the game, such as shaking when it ran over rocky roads. Lucky & Wild had this idea originally, rocking violently in a see-saw-like fashion. Namco executives pushed to have the lightguns fire a single shot when the trigger was squeezed, which Kounoe and others pushed against due to it making the game impossible to play. As a way to differentiate it from other games already on the market, and to what Kounoe describes as \"protect[ing] the pride of the development department, the production team worked to make the game feel fresh and original. Namco's extensive history in the racing game genre, particularly with their Final Lap franchise, allowed the team to build upon those games with their expertise at designing them. Kounoe recalls the toughest part of development to be the controls due to player imbalance. The controls originally were seen as confusing and difficult to implement, leading to long discussions between staff as to how the controls could be made more simplistic and to correct the imbalance. Although 3D racing games were becoming more popular by the early half of the 1990s, Kounoe chose to stick with 2D sprites and used them to create the illusion of a 3D world. The arcade hardware it ran on, the Namco System 2, had strict limitations that made it difficult to work with during production. To figure out how to bypass these setbacks and create the world they envisioned, the team looked to Pole Position for inspiration, which used a clever technique that aligned sprite-based objects alongside the road that made the illusion of a 3D environment. Kounoe implemented this into Lucky & Wild, using realistic arrangements of lampposts, buildings, hedges and billboards to line against the road and create a large sense of depth. These objects and the rate of movement they scrolled past the player were all done by hand, with some minor assistance from Namco's production toolsets. Objects were painstakingly drawn one at a time, with the team using materials like manga and photo albums for reference. It was believed the game was heavily inspired by the film Tango & Cash due to multiple similarities, such as the similar designs of the protagonists and near-identical theme; Kounoe denied this in an interview, claiming that he was unaware of the film's existence during production and that the similarities were merely a coincidence. Lucky & Wild was released in Japan in April 1993, followed by a release in North America a month later. References in other games Lucky & Wild is also borrowed as a fictional American tuning car company brand in the Ridge Racer games with products being muscle cars (similar to those of Danver); the formation of Lucky & Wild protagonists later appeared in Mario Kart Arcade GP DX, with one player driving and the second serving as the gunner. Also, in the first episode of the interactive video series Bear Stearns Bravo, Bear Stearns CEO Jackie Dalton refers to the regulators Franco and Henri by the names \"Lucky & Wild\". Reception Game Machine claims that Lucky & Wild was the third most-popular arcade game of May 1993 in Japan. RePlay also reported Lucky & Wild to be the fourth most-popular deluxe arcade game at the time. Play Meter listed Lucky & Wild to be the twenty-fifth most-popular arcade game at the time as well. Time Extension called it \"one of the most incredible titles of the '90s and a game that sorely deserves to get a lot more attention than it currently does.\" Notes References External links 1993 video games Arcade video games Arcade-only video games Namco arcade games Rail shooters Vehicular combat games Video games about police officers Video games developed in Japan Light gun games"}

{"text": "The First Step to Nobel Prize in Physics is an annual international competition in research projects in physics. It originated and is based in Poland. Participants All the secondary high school students regardless of the country, type of the school, sex, nationality etc. are eligible for the competition. The only conditions are that the school cannot be considered as a university college and the age of the participants should not exceed 20 years on March 31 (every year March 31 is the deadline for submitting the competition papers). There are no restrictions concerning the subject matter of the papers, their level, methods applied etc. All these are left to the participants' choice. The papers, however, have to have a research character and deal with physics topics or topics directly related to physics. The papers are evaluated by the Evaluating Committee, which is nominated by the Organizing Committee. It was recently won by David Rosengarten. History In the first two competitions, only Polish physicists participated in the Evaluation Committee. In the third competition, one non-Polish judge took part in evaluation of the papers. In the fourth competition, the number of physicists from other countries was 10, with 14 being present in the fifth competition. Plans are in place to increase the number of physicists involved from other countries in future competitions. An International Advisory Committee (IAC) was also established. At present, it consists of 25 physicists from different countries. Competition and evaluation The materials on the competition are disseminated to all the countries via diplomatic channels. The competition is also advertised in different physics magazines for pupils and teachers. (Every year about 30 articles on the First Step are published in different countries). Also, different private channels are used. In the first eight competitions the pupils from 67 countries participated. The criteria used when evaluating the papers submitted are geared towards an adult standard; no special consideration is given for the younger age of the participants. There are no prizes such as would be seen in other school-based competitions (cameras, electronics, financial rewards, etc.). Instead, the winners are invited to the Institute for one month for research stays (usually in November). During the stays, they are involved into real research works going on in the Institute. Each year the proceedings with all of the awarded papers are published. Goals The competition has several aims and interests, which include: Promotion of scientific interests among young pupils. Selection of outstanding pupils (this point is especially important in case of pupils from countries or regions in which access to science is difficult) and their promotion (very often winners are sent to better universities and receive appropriate financial help from the local authorities). Stimulation of the schools, parents, local educational centers, etc. for greater activity in work with pupils interested in research (in some countries, some regions and even in some schools a preliminary local selection in organized, sometime such selections involve great numbers of participants) Establishing friendly relations between young physicists (in recent competitions, all winners were invited to the Institute at the same time, were accommodated in the same place, and cooperated with each other). Winners In 2007, the winner was an American student. In 2009, the prize went to Mor Tzaban, a high school student from Netivot, Israel. In 2012, the first prize winner was another Israeli teenager, Yuval Katzenelson of Kiryat Gat, who presented a paper entitled \"Kinetic energy of inert gas in a regenerative system of activated carbon.\" The Israeli delegation won 14 more prizes in the competition: 9 Israelis students won second prize, one won third prize and one won fourth prize.

{"text": "HMS Swale (K217) was a of the Royal Navy (RN) from 1942 to 1955, loaned to the South African Navy for six months at the end of the Second World War. Construction Swale was built to the RN's specifications as a Group I River-class frigate. She was laid down at Smiths Dock Co., South Bank-on-Tees on 19 August 1941 and launched on 16 January 1942. The ship was commissioned into the RN on 24 June 1942 as K 217 and named for the River Swale in Yorkshire, England. War service Early days Swale saw extensive service on convoy escort missions and experienced some of the worst days of the Battle of the Atlantic. In March 1943 she was SO (Senior Officer's ship) of the Escort Group (EG) B5, escorting the slow convoy SC 122 from New York to Liverpool. Of the 51 merchant ships in the convoy, 10 returned to port unable to ride a violent storm; three days later another eight were sunk by U-boats. Swale was to have better fortunes two months later. Escorting slow convoy ONS 7 bound for Halifax, Canada, she sank the off Cape Farewell, Greenland on the night of 17 May. The U-boat had earlier torpedoed the steamer Aymeric, the last British cargo ship in the Atlantic to be sunk that month, claiming the lives of 53 men. Under the command of Lieutenant Commander John Jackson, DSC, RNR, Swale moved astern of the doomed Aymeric and made ASDIC (sonar) contact. After a succession of depth charge and Hedgehog attacks, she was rewarded with the sound of several loud explosions and the appearance of burning oil on the surface. The convoy continued to Canada without further loss. Convoy Faith episode On 10 July 1943 Swale sailed Gibraltar to rendezvous with the small, fast Convoy Faith (one of the 'Winston Specials') en route from Greenock in Scotland to Freetown, Sierra Leone. The convoy had comprised two troopships, the and the Canadian Pacific liner , and the transport , (which was carrying ammunition), escorted by three warships. At about 2000 hrs on 11 July while west of Vigo, the convoy was subjected to a devastating air attack by three Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor aircraft from Merignac airfield near Bordeaux. By the time Swale arrived at 2235 hrs, both California and Duchess of York had been hit, set on fire, and abandoned, to be sunk later by torpedoes from their escorts. Swale too was attacked by the Condors, bombs falling just astern. After making an A/S sweep, Swale was ordered to escort Port Fairy, which had escaped unscathed, to Casablanca, ahead of the other escorts which were still searching for survivors. On the evening of the next day, the two ships were attacked by two Fw 200s returning from a reconnaissance mission off the Portuguese coast. Despite the interception and strafing of the Condors by two US Navy PBY Catalinas Port Fairy was hit on her port quarter by a bomb which started a fire next to her magazine. Swale came alongside, took off 64 survivors from the two troopships together with eight passengers, and helped extinguish the blaze with her hoses. Port Fairy was repaired at Casablanca and remained in service until 1965. Last success On 6 April 1944, while escorting the slow convoy SC 156 from Halifax, Canada to Loch Ewe, Scotland, Swale sank with depth charges northwest of the Azores after the U-boat penetrated the escort screen and sank the Norwegian merchantmen Ruth 1 and South America. Post-war service Swale was loaned to the South African Navy on 26 June 1945 as but returned to the RN in January 1946. She was scrapped on 26 February 1955.

{"text": "Jack Binion is an American businessman. Binion is the son of casino magnate Benny Binion and worked for his father at Binion's Horseshoe, a casino and hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Biography Binion became president of the Horseshoe in 1963 at the age of 26. His stature within the organization grew following the Horseshoe Casino's 1970 hosting of the first World Series of Poker, which would become the largest poker tournament in the world. Privately held, Binion's Horseshoe was one of Nevada's most successful casino operations. In 1998, following a protracted legal battle for control of the Horseshoe among Benny Binion's heirs, Binion sold his interest in Binion's Horseshoe to his sister, Becky Behnen, while retaining a token 1% interest in the operation so that he could lawfully retain his Nevada Gaming License. He also acquired the rights to the Horseshoe brand outside of Nevada. Binion went on to form Horseshoe Gaming Holding Corporation which developed and operated several riverboat casinos under the Horseshoe name. Binion continued to promote the casinos for Harrah's Entertainment following his sale of the company in 2004 to Harrah's. As of 2008, Binion's name appears on the \"Jack Binion's Steakhouse\" at Horseshoe Tunica and Horseshoe Hammond and several of the Horseshoe-branded casinos still carry slot machines bearing Binion's likeness called \"Who Wants To Be A Binionaire?\" that originated before the Harrah's acquisition. While running Horseshoe Gaming, Binion started the World Poker Open which at one time was a major feeder tournament for the World Series of Poker. Binion was inducted into the American Gaming Association's Gaming Hall of Fame on June 11, 2004. The following year on July 6, 2005, the World Series of Poker, inducted him into the Poker Hall of Fame. In July 2006, Binion became chairman of Wynn Resorts. His responsibilities included opening the Wynn Macau. He has since resigned the position but has remained with Wynn Resorts in a consulting role.

{"text": "Trinity High School is a Roman Catholic secondary school located in Eastfield, Rutherglen, Scotland near the city of Glasgow. It was established in 1971. The current head teacher is Allison Craig who took office in 2021 with incumbent Peter Bollen leaving his post. Overview Trinity High School was established in 1971 to provide a combined Catholic secondary education provision for Cambuslang and Rutherglen under the new comprehensive system, until that time based separately in limited accommodation at St Bride's and St Columbkille's schools respectively, but with many pupils from the towns having to attend schools either in Glasgow, further into Lanarkshire at Hamilton or Motherwell, or in East Kilbride. Initially Trinity used buildings in Cambuslang previously used by Gateside School, which had been supplanted as the local non-denominational facility with the opening of Cathkin High School on a different site on the edge of town. In 1977 the Trinity campus at Eastfield was opened, although the Gateside buildings continued to be used by the school for a few years (it was later used by South Lanarkshire College, and eventually demolished in 2008). In 2007 the original Trinity was demolished; a new school was completed in the same Glenside Drive location. Pupils returned in August 2009. A council-run sports centre and swimming pool (known as South Lanarkshire Lifestyle Eastfield) constructed a few years earlier shares the site, with the facilities used by the Trinity pupils during the school day and available for community use at other times. The school uses a traditional house system. The pupils are organised into one of three guidance houses, formerly having been four. The three houses are Iona, Dunkeld and Melrose. Jedburgh was previously a house but was removed during re-organisation of the school faculty. The school hosts many afterschool clubs and has competed in national competitions. Around mid-October an awards ceremony is held to honour pupils who have achieved academically and through sports activities. Although a Catholic school, it accepts students from other religious denominations. Trinity's affiliated primary schools include St Anthony's in Springhall, St Bride's in Cambuslang, St Cadoc's in Halfway, St Charles' in Newton, St Columbkille's in Rutherglen, St Joachim's in Carmyle, and St Mark's in Blairbeth. Gallery History New buildings, move to Hamilton On 5 November 2007 the former school building in Glenside Drive, being demolished as part of the \"Schools Modernisation Programme\", was set ablaze. Before it was set on fire, it was due to be destroyed by contractors InspirdED onto whom the council had passed responsibility. The fire broke out in the school on Guy Fawkes Night. A total of eight crews, 60 firefighters in total, worked through the night to control the blaze and by 1:00 AM on Monday morning the fire was finally extinguished. On Bonfire night there were several incidents throughout Scotland in the aftermath of the festival that sparked fires similar to the Trinity School blaze as evidenced by the Strathclyde Fire and Police services, and in addition this gained widespread media attention. During the complete reconstruction of the school, pupils at Trinity High School were temporarily located at the old Holy Cross High School buildings in Hamilton, with a replacement for Holy Cross having already been completed nearby (these have also since been demolished in the South Lanarkshire Schools Modernisation project).

{"text": "is a 1989 racing arcade game developed and published by Namco. It was released in North America by Atari Games, and was ported to the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1991 as Quad Challenge. Gameplay Players take control of four quad bikes (red for Player 1, white for Player 2, yellow for Player 3, and green for Player 4), which are competing in an \"off-road\" race. They all have a preset amount of time in which to complete a full lap of the track, but for each lap of the track that is successfully completed, the players' time is extended. However, if one of the players cannot manage to successfully complete the current lap of the track before the time runs out, that player's game will instantly be over and the race will continue without them. The players must complete between three and six full laps of the track in order to win (the number is dependent on how both of the cabinets are set, as with Namco's own Final Lap). The players can also encounter between four and seven blue CPU-controlled bikes on the track, as the number is dependent on how many people are playing (seven for one player, six for two players, five for three, and four for four). Reception and legacy In North America, the arcade version was the top-grossing new video game on the RePlay arcade charts in April 1990. The Sega Genesis version was released with little commercial fanfare, and it never made major sales figures. Four Trax is considered to be one of the first off-road racing games for a console system. It was released more than 10 years before ATV Offroad Fury for the PlayStation 2 brought the genre into the 21st century. However, it has become a niche genre again since THQ discontinued their MX vs. ATV series. Even prior to the cancellation of the MX vs. ATV series, driving an ATV around closed-circuit tracks never appealed much to the mainstream audience of gamers.

He excavated at Nineveh, Ur, Nebo and Carchemish among many other sites. Biography Thompson was born in Kensington, and educated at Colet Court, St Paul's School and Caius College, Cambridge, where he read oriental (Hebrew and Aramaic) languages. In 1904 he found the remains of the temple of Nabu in Nineveh, which were destroyed in 2016 by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In 1918 Mesopotamia fell into British hands, and the trustees of the British Museum applied to have an archaeologist attached to the army in the field to protect antiquities from injury. As a captain in the Intelligence Service serving in the region and a former assistant in the British Museum, R. C. Thompson was commissioned to start the work. After a short investigation of Ur, he dug at Shahrain and the mounds at Tell al-Lahm. After the First World War he held a fellowship at Merton College, Oxford. The writer Agatha Christie was invited by Thompson, along with her husband the archaeologist Max Mallowan, to the excavation site at Nineveh in 1931. She dedicated her story Lord Edgware Dies to \"Dr and Mrs Campbell Thompson\". In return he dedicated his melodrama in blank verse Digger's Fancy to \"Agatha and Max Mallowan\".

Biography Born in Trenton, New Jersey, Katz received his MA from the University of Buffalo in 1925, and his PhD from the Syracuse University in 1928 under Floyd Henry Allport, founder of the American experimental social psychology. In 1928 Katz started his academic career at the faculty of Princeton University. In World War II Katz did government research in Washington with a group of social scientist under Rensis Likert, who eventually founded the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. In 1943 Katz went to the Brooklyn College, where he headed the psychology department. From 1947 to 1974 his academic career culminated at the University of Michigan where he was Professor in the Department of Psychology and fellow at the Institute for Social Research. Here Katz cooperated with Theodore Newcomb, who founded Michigan's doctoral program in social psychology and he chaired the program from 1947 to 1953. In honor of both since 1970 the University of Michigan organizes an annual Katz-Newcomb Lecture. Katz was awarded the Gold Medal of the American Psychological Association, the Lewin Award of the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, the Award of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, the Award of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Work Katz produced classic studies of racial stereotyping and prejudice, and attitude change, and his pursuit of the connections between individual psychology and social systems helped to found the field of organizational psychology. An important methodological contribution was his open system theory, presented in The Social Psychology of Organizations (1966, later revised), which was co-authored by Robert L. Kahn.

{"text": "Paula Hyman (September 30, 1946 – December 15, 2011) was an American social historian who served as the Lucy Moses Professor of Modern Jewish History at Yale University. She served as the president of the American Academy for Jewish Research from 2004 to 2008. She also was the first female dean of the Seminary College of Jewish Studies at the Jewish Theological Seminary from 1981 to 1986. Hyman was a pioneer for gender equality in Jewish religious practice, helping push for women's ordination as Conservative rabbis. Jewish historian Hasia Diner credits Hyman as the originator of the study of Jewish women’s history. Early life and career Paula Ellen Hyman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on September 30, 1946 to Ida Hyman (née Tatelman) and Sydney Hyman, two first generation Jewish-Americans from Eastern Europe. Ida was of Russian descent and Sydney of Lithuanian. Hyman was the first of three daughters. Her mother worked as a bookkeeper and was in charge of the home while her father was an office manager. In her childhood household, Jewish culture was integral to family life. Starting in high school and continuing in early college, Hyman studied Hebrew and classic Jewish works at Hebrew Teachers College in Boston, where she earned a Bachelors of Jewish Education in 1966. In 1968, she graduated summa cum laude with a B.A. from Radcliffe College. While at Radcliffe, Hyman was mentored by Jewish historians Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi and Isadore Twersky. After Radcliffe, Hyman went on to do post-graduate work at Columbia University starting in 1972, where she would later be a professor, and earn her Ph.D. in History in 1975. Hyman’s Columbia doctoral dissertation was titled From Dreyfus to Vichy: The Remaking of French Jewry, 1906–1939 and was published by Columbia University Press in 1979. The content of her doctoral dissertation focused on Eastern European Jews immigrating to France up until World War II and how that changed French Jewry. This book was a finalist in the National Jewish Book Award competition in History. While in graduate school, Hyman co-authored a book titled The Jewish Woman in America with Charlotte Baum and Sonya Michel. The book earned her another Jewish Book Award in 1998 for Women's Studies. After graduating from Columbia, Hyman was a professor there and later at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. There, she was the first female dean of the Seminary College of Jewish Studies. She served in this position until 1986, when she moved to Yale University. Later life and death Over the years, Hyman became known as a prominent advocate for gender equality in Jewish religious life, both in her professional and personal lives. At Yale, Hyman was the Lucy Moses Professor of Modern Jewish History and served as the chair of the Program in Judaic Studies for over 10 years. This appointment made her the first woman to head a Jewish Studies program at a prominent university. Over the course of her career Hyman authored ten books and sixty articles. Additionally, Hyman was the President of the American Association for Jewish Research from 2004 to 2008, the co-chair of the academic council of the National Foundation for Jewish Culture from 1995 to 2002, a member of the executive board of the Association for Jewish Studies (AJS) and the Leo Baeck Institute, while being on the editorial board for various journals including Association for Jewish Studies Review, Jewish Social Studies, Journal for the Feminist Study of Religion, andYIVO Annual. Additionally, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award in Historical Studies from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture. For over two decades she edited The Modern Jewish Experience from the Indiana University Press. She was the recipient of various honors and awards: a 1999 National Jewish Book Award, a 2004 Achievement Award in Historical Studies from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture, and honorary degrees from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in 2000, the Hebrew Union College in 2002, and the Hebrew College in 2010. Hyman died on December 15, 2011 from a long fight with breast cancer, which she was very open about. She is survived by her husband, Dr. Stanley Rosenbaum, her two daughters, Judith and Adina, two grandchildren, Ma’ayan and Aviv, her mother Ida, and her two sisters, Merle and Toby. After her death, Hyman was commemorated by the commencement of the Paula Hyman Oral History Project, created in part by the Women’s Caucus of the AJS. Hyman was part of this caucus until the time of her death. The goal of this oral history was to conserve the reflections of the founding members of the caucus. Additionally, Hyman was commemorated by the creation of the Paula E. Hyman Mentoring Program, which selects every year young women scholars of Jewish women's and genders studies and pairs them with older mentors in the same field. Activism In 1971, Hyman helped found Ezrat Nashim, a Jewish activist group whose goal was the ordination of women as Conservative rabbis and cantors, a foreshadowing of her later position as a champion of gender equality in religious Jewish life. While at Columbia, Hyman and other Jewish feminists wrote a manifesto to call for the ordination of women rabbis and cantors in Conservative Judaism, which they then delivered to hundreds of conservative rabbis at a Rabbinical Assembly. The title of this manifesto was “Jewish Women Call for Change.” In both her personal and professional life, Hyman championed feminist ideology and sought to end political and historical sexism. Additionally, when she became the first woman to join organizations in the United States, Israel, and Europe, she would be certain to attain the participation of other women, helping further her activist identity. Research interests and reception Hyman's research interests included topics in modern European and American Jewish history, with a special emphasis on the history of women and gender. Her work can be summed up as the interaction of Judaism and feminism in various countries. Some of her particular interests are the way in which French Jewry changed from the Dreyfus Affair to the present, and how Eastern European Jewish women immigrants interacted with work outside the home. On the latter topic, Hyman is known for her works on Jewish women in New York as activists in events such as the kosher meat boycott of 1902 and the New York rent strike of 1907. Her interest in such activism finds its base in her growing up in the 1960s, an era known for its social changes including a widely-fought feminist movement. Hyman was recognized as one of the founders of Jewish women's studies and was seen as a role model for her colleagues and students for her dedication to this field. This field finds one of its starts in Hyman's The Jewish Woman in America. In addition, she was seen as a changing force in how the modern Jewish experience is understood by scholars and laymen alike. This shift included a newfound focus on the daily ins and outs of American and European Jewish life as well as exposing the lives of often overlooked populations, such as women, through a use of popular and archival sources. After Hyman's death, Nashim: A Journal of Jewish Women's Studies and Gender Issues dedicated issue twenty-two of their journal to Hyman.

{"text": "The Anaconda Copper Mining Company, known as the Amalgamated Copper Company from 1899 to 1915, was an American mining company headquartered in Butte, Montana. It was one of the largest trusts of the early 20th century and one of the largest mining companies in the world for much of the 20th century. Marcus Daly bought the original silver mine, named the Anaconda, in 1880. Daly partnered with George Hearst, James Ben Ali Haggin and Lloyd Tevis in 1881 to develop it, and the company expanded dramatically in 1882 with the discovery of huge copper deposits. In 1883, Daly began building a smelter and the town of Anaconda to process copper mined in Butte. In 1899, with Hearst and Tevis deceased, Haggin retired and Daly restructured the enterprise into the Amalgamated Copper Company, bringing in H H Rogers and William Rockefeller. By 1910, Amalgamated had expanded its operations and bought the assets of all other copper companies operating in Butte. In 1922, Anaconda bought mining operations in Mexico and Chile; the latter hosted the largest mine in the world and for a time yielded two-thirds of the company's profits. The company added aluminum reduction to its portfolio in 1955. In the 1950s, the company switched over from underground to open-pit mining. In 1960 its operations employed 37,000 employees in North America and Chile. Anaconda Copper was purchased by the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) on January 12, 1977. ARCO halted production at the Anaconda smelter in 1980, and mining ceased completely in 1982 when the deep pumps draining the Berkeley Pit and the underground mines were shut off, allowing the Pit and mines to fill. The company presently only exists as a major environmental liability for BP, who bought out ARCO in 2000. Its former operations are now the largest Superfund site in the country; CERCLA liability passed to BP upon its acquisition of ARCO. History of Anaconda Copper Beginnings Marcus Daly, a self-taught miner, engineer and geologist, bought a small silver mine called Anaconda in 1880. At the time, Daly was working for the Walker brothers, mining investors and bankers from Salt Lake City, Utah. He was a mining superintendent of the Alice, a silver mine in Walkerville, a suburb of Butte. While working in the Alice, he noticed significant quantities of high grade copper ore. Daly scouted the Anaconda and several other mines in the area and recommended the mine to the Walker brothers, who sent a professional geologist to inspect the Anaconda. The Walkers were not interested in the mine, and Daly sold his interest in the Alice to purchase it himself. Placer gold and silver lode mining had taken place at Butte, placer mining at Helena, Bannock and Virginia City, Montana territory respectively, and Butte was nearing the end of its silver lode mining phase. Lacking capital to develop the mine, Daly sought financing from San Francisco mining magnate George Hearst and his partners, James Ben Ali Haggin and Lloyd Tevis, of Hearst, Haggin, Tevis, and Co. and the Anaconda Company was born in 1881 with Daly as a 25% partner in the enterprise. Daly had recommended Hearst purchase the Ontario mine, a silver mine in Alta, Utah, which consequently made Hearst many millions. Huge deposits of copper were soon developed and Daly became a copper magnate. When surrounding silver mines \"played out\" and closed, Daly bought up the neighboring mines, forming a mining company. In 1883, Daly built a smelter at Anaconda, Montana, building a company town to support the workers, and connected his smelter to Butte by his Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railway. Butte became one of the most prosperous cities in the country, often called \"the Richest Hill on Earth.\" From 1892 through 1903, the Anaconda mine itself was the largest copper-producing mine in the world. It produced more than $300 billion worth of metal in its lifetime. Rothschilds In 1889 the Rothschilds tried to gain control of the world copper market. In 1892 the French Rothschilds began negotiations to buy the Anaconda mine. In mid-October 1895 the Rothschilds, French and British, bought out the stock in Anaconda held by Hearst's widow, Phoebe Apperson Hearst, for $7.5 million. By the late 1890s the Rothschilds probably had control over the sale of about forty percent of the world's copper production. Rockefellers The Rothschilds' role in Anaconda was brief. In 1899, Daly teamed up with two directors of Standard Oil to create the Amalgamated Copper Mining Company which grew to become one of the largest trusts of the early 20th century. The leading roles were played by Henry Huttleston Rogers (John D. Rockefeller's friend and a key man in his Standard Oil businesses) and William Rockefeller (John's brother). They were aided by company promoter Thomas W. Lawson. Although Rogers and William Rockefeller were Standard Oil directors, the company of Standard Oil did not have a stake in this business, nor did its founder and head, John D. Rockefeller, who disliked such stock promotions. By 1899 Amalgamated Copper acquired majority stock in the Anaconda Copper Company, and the Rothschilds appear to have had no further role in the company. By his death in 1900, Marcus Daly had just become president of the holding company valued at $75 million. Lawson later had a falling out with Rogers and Rockefeller, and wrote of the experience in a book Frenzied Finance (1905). Colored by Lawson's bitterness, the book offered insight into aspects of high finance. Amalgamated competes in copper At the beginning of the 1900s, due to electrification (and Amalgamated's maintenance of an artificially high copper price), copper was very profitable, and copper mining expanded rapidly. Between 1899 and 1915, Anaconda, controlled by Standard Oil insiders, stayed under the name of Amalgamated Copper Company. Amalgamated was in conflict with powerful copper king F. Augustus Heinze, who also owned mines in Butte; in 1902 he consolidated these as the United Copper Company. Neither organization was able to monopolize copper extraction in Montana. In addition, although Butte was the most prolific copper-mining district in the world, Amalgamated could not control production from other copper producing districts, such as those in Michigan, Utah, Arizona, or countries outside the United States. Marcus Daly passed away in 1900. His widow began a close friendship with a shrewd, intelligent businessman, John D. Ryan, who assumed the presidency of Daly's bank and management of his widow's fortune. The leaders of Amalgamated turned to Ryan, famous for his negotiation skills, for help in creating a monopoly at Butte. Control of the areas producing mines was a key to high income. Ryan convinced Heinze to walk away with abundant compensation, allowing Amalgamated to take over Heinze's properties as well as the properties of William A. Clark (another Butte copper magnate). Amalgamated gained almost complete control of Butte's copper as they merged with these companies. The reorganized company was again named Anaconda. Ryan made its president and rewarded with a significant package of Amalgamated shares. The \"right hand\" of John Ryan was Cornelius Kelley, a young attorney, who soon was given the position of vice-president. Henry Rogers died suddenly in 1909 of a stroke, but William Rockefeller brought in his son Percy Rockefeller to help with leadership. In 1912 and 13, the Pujo Committee investigated William Rockefeller and others for allegedly earning $30 million in profit through cornering of the copper market and \"synchronizing with artificially enforced activity\" in Amalgamated Copper stock in the New York Stock Exchange. The golden twenties During the 1920s, metal prices went up and mining activity increased. Those were really the golden years for Anaconda. The company was managed by the Ryan-Kelley team and was growing fast, expanding into the exploitation of new base metal resources: manganese and zinc. In 1922 the company acquired mining operations in Chile and Mexico (Cananea). The mining operation in Chile (Chuquicamata), was acquired from the Guggenheims in 1923. It cost Anaconda $77 million and was the largest copper mine in the world. It produced copper yielding two-thirds to three-fourths of the Anaconda Company's profits. The same year ACM purchased American Brass Company, the nation's largest brass fabricator and a major consumer of copper and zinc. In 1926 Anaconda acquired the Giesche company, a large mining and industrial firm, operating in the Upper Silesia region of Poland. This nation had gained independence after World War I. At that time Anaconda was the fourth-largest company in the world. These heady times, however, were short-lived. Great speculation In 1928, Ryan and Rockefeller aggressively speculated on Anaconda shares by manipulating the supply of copper (reducing supply to corner the market), causing shares to go up at first; at which point they sold, which caused stocks to fall; then buying them back. Known today as a \"pump and dump\", at the time the actions were not illegal and took place frequently. Anaconda was producing copper at such a rate they had tremendous stockpiles. To control prices, the company only sold the requested supply. Under the pressure of a \"joint account\" set up by Ryan and Rockefeller of nearly a million and a half shares of Anaconda Copper Company, prices fluctuated from $40 in December 1928, to $128 in March 1929. Selling large volumes of shares rather quickly causes the bottom to fall out of the market; investors lose confidence and dump their shares, causing a domino effect. Small investors would purchase blocks of shares on credit, and when they could not sell at or above the given price, had to sell the shares at a loss when the banks called on their loans for the purchase of said shares. Smaller investors were completely wiped out. The results are still considered one of the greatest fleecings in Wall Street history. The United States Senate held hearings on the stock manipulations, concluding that those operations cost the public at the very least, $150 million. A 1933 Senate banking committee called these operations the greatest frauds in American banking history, a leading cause of the 1929 stock market crash and 1930s depression. Great Depression In 1929 Anaconda Copper Mining Co. issued new stock and used some of the money to buy shares of speculative companies. When the market crashed on October 29, 1929, Anaconda suffered serious financial setbacks. At the same time, copper prices started dropping dramatically. During the winter of 1932–33, as the Depression expanded, copper prices dropped to 10.3 cents per pound, down from an average of 29.5 cents per pound only two years earlier. The Great Depression took a toll in the mining industry; decline in demand led to the company making massive layoffs in both the United States and Chile (up to 66 percent unemployment rate in the Chilean mines). On March 26, 1931, Anaconda cut its dividend rate 40%. John D. Ryan died in 1933 and was buried in a copper coffin. His mighty Anaconda shares, once worth $175 each, had dropped to $3 at the low of the Great Depression. Cornelius Kelley became the chairman in 1940. Beginning of WWII Butte mining, like most U.S. industry, remained depressed until the dawn of World War II, when the demand for war materials greatly increased the need for copper, zinc, and manganese. Anaconda ranked 58th among United States corporations in the value of World War II-military production contracts. That relieved some of the economic tensions. The end of World War II brought another depression in the copper industry because of a decline in demand after war production ended. 1950s During the post-war years, demand and prices for copper dropped. At the same time mining costs had risen precipitously. As a result, copper production from Butte's underground vein mines dropped to only 45,000 mt annually. Anaconda tasked its engineers with devising new techniques to keep mining profitable. The answer was called the \"Greater Butte Project\" (GBP). The project would exploit lower-grade underground reserves by the block-caving method. Anaconda sank a new shaft, the Kelley, and the mine began producing in 1948. The new method was successful, although short-lived. They also began stripping ground for what was to become the Berkeley Pit. In 1956 Anaconda netted the largest annual income in its history: $111.5 million. After that year, ore grades continued their decline, mining costs were rising each year, and profits were diminishing. To survive, the company switched to open-pit mining, a very area-consuming method. The Berkeley Pit kept expanding and ate away at the older parts of Butte. 1970s In 1971, Chile's newly elected Socialist president Salvador Allende confiscated the Chuquicamata mine from Anaconda, stripping Anaconda of two-thirds of its copper production. Allende was overthrown violently in 1973 in an operation backed by the United States government, and the successor government of Augusto Pinochet paid Anaconda compensation of $250 million. Losses from the Chilean takeover however, had seriously weakened the company's financial position. Later in 1971, Anaconda's Mexican copper mine Compañía Minera de Cananea, S.A. was nationalized by president Luis Echeverría Álvarez's government. An unwise investment in the unsuccessful Twin Buttes mine in southern Arizona further weakened the company. In 1977 Anaconda was sold to Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) for $700 million. However, the purchase turned out to be a regrettable decision for ARCO. Lack of experience with hard-rock mining, and a sudden drop in the price of copper to sixty-odd cents a pound, the lowest in years, caused ARCO to suspend all underground mining operations in Butte in 1980. ARCO closed the Berkeley Pit and shut off the deep pumps in 1982, allowing the pit and mines to fill with water. The Continental Pit, the last active Anaconda mining property in Butte, was closed in 1982, but resumed mining in the early 2000's. Six years after ARCO acquired rights to the \"Richest Hill on Earth\", Butte's mines were completely idle. ARCO founder, Robert Orville Anderson, stated \"he hoped Anaconda's resources and expertise would help him launch a major shale-oil venture, but that the world oil glut and the declining price of petroleum made shale oil moot.\" At the time of the sale to ARCO, Anaconda had large working hard coal holdings in the Black Thunder mine at Thunder Basin, Wyoming. ARCO planned to diversify its energy business into coal. In June 1998, Arch Coal completed the acquisition of the coal assets of Atlantic Richfield. Superfund site Closing down the mines was not the end of the new owner's problems. The areas of Butte, Anaconda, and the Clark Fork River in this vicinity became highly contaminated by a century of mining and smelting operations. Milling and smelting processes produced wastes with high concentrations of arsenic, as well as copper, cadmium, lead, zinc, and other heavy metals. Beginning in 1980s, the Environmental Protection Agency designated the Upper Clark Fork river basin and many associated areas as Superfund sites—the nation's largest. The EPA named ARCO as the \"potentially responsible party.\" As a result, ARCO was obliged to remediate (clean up) the area. Since then, ARCO and BP have spent hundreds of millions of dollars decontaminating and rehabilitating the area, though the job is far from finished. ARCO merged with BP in 2000. BP in turn sold most of ARCO to Tesoro in 2010, but retains responsibility for cleanup of the Anaconda operations and uses ARCO as a subsidiary to handle Anaconda-related lawsuits. Aluminum operations in Columbia Falls Anaconda diversified into aluminum production in 1952, when they purchased rights to build an aluminum reduction plant in Columbia Falls. After two years of construction, the plant went online in August 1955. Following two expansions in the 1960s, the plant had a peak output capacity of 180,000 tons annually. ARCO kept the plant open after Butte copper operations ceased in 1982, and sold the plant to a group of investors led by a former ARCO executive in 1985, due to high electricity costs and low market prices. As Columbia Falls Aluminum Company (CFAC), the plant continued operations as an independent company until it was purchased by Swiss metals giant Glencore in 1999. Glencore continued CFAC operations through 2009, when it temporarily shuttered the plant due to high electricity costs and low market prices. On March 3, 2015, the closure became permanent. Anaconda Copper in literature and film Dashiel Hammett's 1929 novel \"Red Harvest\" was based on Hammett's experience as a Pinkerton Detective working at the Anaconda Mine in Butte and the Anaconda Road massacre in 1920. The independent documentary An Injury to One (2002) by Travis Wilkerson chronicles the history of Anaconda in Butte, Montana, and its efforts to suppress unionization by its workers. Organizer Frank Little of the IWW was lynched and no one was ever prosecuted for his murder. The short film ends with a discussion of Berkeley Pit. Michael Punke's Fire and Brimstone: The North Butte Mining Disaster of 1917 covers the Speculator Mine disaster of 1917 in Butte, and the impact that had on big mining and unions in Montana. The 2008 PBS documentary Butte, America covers similar themes. In the film The Motorcycle Diaries (2004), Che Guevara and his friend Alberto Granado watch as desperately poor men are being hired for very dangerous work in Anaconda's Chuquicamata mine in Chile. The novel Sweet Thunder (2013) by Ivan Doig recounts a journalistic duel between a union newspaper and a company newspaper in 1920s Butte. Semiotics \"Copper Collar\" The term copper collar, coined in the late 1800s, was a metaphor used to describe a person or company directly controlled by the Anaconda Company. From the 1920s until 1959, journalists working at the newspapers could write nothing that clashed with the company's business enterprises. Journalists were thus not allowed to develop and exercise their professional skills through their news judgment - lawyers and accountants made news judgments, not journalists — and were frozen for decades in this pre-professional model. By 1920, the Anaconda Company owned several Montana newspapers including the Butte Post, Butte Miner, Anaconda Standard, Daily Missoulian, Helena Independent, and Billings Gazette. The Anaconda Company controlled the economic and political dealings throughout Montana well into the mid-1900s. As the state's largest employer, Anaconda dominated Montana politics. In the political arena the \"copper collar\" symbolized influence, wealth, and power. In 1894, Montana held an election to decide which city would be its capital. Marcus Daly, an Anaconda supporter, used his power over the papers to further his cause. While campaigning, \"Anaconda's supporters portrayed Helena as a center of avarice and elitism while promoting their choice as the pick of the working man. In return, Helena's backers claimed that if the victory should go to their opponent the entire state would be strangled by the \"copper collar\" of Daly's Anaconda Copper Mining Company.\" Daly's campaign was unsuccessful and Helena became the state's capital. Flexing its political muscle again in 1903, the Anaconda Company closed down operations within all of Montana, putting 15,000 men out of work until the legislature enacted the regulations it demanded. Montanans were angered by this decision and from that point forward, to suggest a politician \"wore a copper collar\", could cost him the election. The copper collar symbolized oppression and control to the people of Butte. In the early 20th century, Butte's culture with its perverse pride in its wide open character was a response to the people's belief in the all-encompassing power of the company. Butte's bars, gambling dens, dance halls, and brothels were among the few public institutions not owned or controlled by Anaconda. It was not only the hazards of mining and the grim environment of Butte that propelled men and women to frenzied gaiety, but also the thought that here were arenas of self-expression denied them elsewhere in a city ringed by the copper collar. Choosing sides in this battle was unavoidable. According to Author Fisher's article, \"Montana: Land of the Copper Collar,\" \"Six months is the longest one may live in Montana without making the decision whether one is 'for the Company' or 'against the Company.' The all-pervading and unrelenting nature of the struggle admits of no neutrals. Since the territory's admission to statehood in 1889 the struggle has continued.\" The term \"copper collar\" was used in historical novels set in that period. In The Old Copper Collar (1957), a tale of the course of a senatorial election in Helena in the early 20th century, Dan Cushman refers to the \"copper collar\": \"At this point the galleries packed with Bennett sympathizers commenced heckling him with suggestions he wore the Copper Collar, but these hoots and catcalls he contemptuously ignored, reiterated his freedom from all cliques, factions, and corporations and that his purpose had been purely and simply to prove or disprove unlawful practices, and sat down.\" Even the suggestion that a person wore the \"copper collar\" created pandemonium from the crowd. Ivan Doig refers to the \"copper collar\" in his novel Work Song (2010). In 1919, Gracie resists the powerful Anaconda Company as they try to force her to sell her property. She says, \"Leave this house at once, Whoever-You-Are Morgan. I'll not have under my roof a man who wears the copper collar.\" The workers who are under the \"copper collar\" are referred to as \"snakes\" and the Anaconda Company is referred to as an \"ogre\". The \"copper collar\" symbolized different things to different people but \"the Anaconda Company used the tactics of an authoritarian state to quash a legitimate labor movement within its corporate fiefdom. That the press, an elemental part of democracy, was used in the assault marks a black period in the history of American journalism.\" In Homelands: A Geography of Culture and Place across America, John B. Wright writes that for decades, the Anaconda Company: mined and smelted metal, leveled forests, owned the newspapers, bribed the legislature, set the wages, murdered union organizers, exported the earnings, and finally shut down, leaving Butte and Anaconda the poorest cities in the states and the largest EPA Superfund site in the country. The phrase \"copper collar\" is also an example of metonymy when it is substituted for the act of the Anaconda Company controlling a person. It is closely related to the company because it is made of copper, which is what the company mined. A collar is a device used to control, which is what the company used the copper collar for. In the Semiotic Square for the \"copper collar\" (see illustration), Marcus Daly is considered the assertion and Miners is the negation in the first binary pair. The second binary relationship is created on the \"control\" axis. Union, the not Marcus Daly element, is considered to be the complex term, and \"copper collar\", the Miner element, is the neutral term. Both a union and the \"copper collar\" are things that are used to gain control. The Anaconda Company used the copper collar to gain control of the papers and legislature, and the miners wanted to establish a union to gain some control over their working conditions.

{"text": "Lockleys is an inner western suburb of Adelaide, in the City of West Torrens. Australian Bureau of Statistics data from May 2021 revealed that Adelaide's western suburbs had the lowest unemployment rate in South Australia. History The area was inhabited by the Kaurna people before the British colonisation of South Australia. The area was subject to flooding by the River Torrens, which originally ran into an area named \"The Reedbeds\" in the upper reaches of the Port River. In the 1930s the Torrens Channel, also named Breakout Creek, was cut through the coastal dunes to Gulf St Vincent, to drain the wetlands and eliminate the flooding. A large part of Lockleys is within a bend of the River Torrens. Hence, prior to subdivision, the area was renowned for its rich soil, market gardens and greenhouses. The name comes from a property (section 145) owned by Charles Brown Fisher, then Edward Meade Bagot and Gabriel Bennett, who built a course there for amateur horse racing. The property was rented by trainers J. Eden Savill and C. Leslie Macdonald for their Lockleys Stables where many good racehorses were prepared. Hank family The area was divided for housing. However, the Hank family lived on Torrens Avenue, Lockleys and had established 11 acres of market garden there after world war I. The Hank brothers (Ray, Bill and Bob) all attended the Lockleys Primary School in Brooklyn Park and would all become footballers for the West Torrens Football Club in the SANFL. Bob Hank would go on to become an AFL Hall of Fame inductee, winning the Magarey Medal in both 1946 and 1947 and winning a record 9 league best and fairest awards for his club. A pavilion in the eastern grandstand at Adelaide Oval is named the Bob Hank Pavilion and the grandstand at Thebarton Oval is named the Hank Brothers Stand after these Australian Football legends. Bob Hank also famously clean bowled Sir Donald Bradman in a District Cricket final in March 1947 whilst playing for the West Torrens Cricket Club against Bradman's Kensington Cricket Club. John Martin's warehouse The former John Martin's department store had a bulk warehouse on Pierson Street, which was also a storage location for the floats used in the company's annual Christmas Pageant. The warehouse was converted by EDS for a data and call centre, which opened in 1996, and later owned by the Maras Group and operated by Westpac as a mortgage processing centre. In September 2021 a development application was announced for rezoning the call centre and adjacent child care centre, to allow a medium density residential development to be built on the site. Windsor Theatre The Windsor Theatre, located at 362 Henley Beach Road, was originally built as a RSL hall in March 1925, with the construction cost of £3,800 covered by community fund-raising, with much of it donated by John Mellor. It was called the Lockleys Memorial Hall. On 10 October in the same year, the hall was used by Lyric Theatres Ltd to screen a film, and soon became a successful movie theatre. At some point it was named the Odeon Star (indicating ownership by D. Clifford Theatres). The Windsor Group acquired the cinema in October 1948, renaming it as the Windsor Theatre, and by 1949 the lease had been acquired by Ozone Theatres Ltd. During the 1950s the cinema was substantially upgraded. The \"Nostalgia Walk\" was created, with hundreds of original movie posters lining the walls. It seated 500 people, and was the first cinema in Adelaide to sell popcorn. The Windsor ceased operating in August 2012, and remained mostly vacant for a couple of years after that. In 2018, the theatre was purchased by the City of West Torrens., who demolished it in early 2021despite public debate and much resistance from organisations which saw its heritage and cultural value to the area. During demolition, a hidden basement was rediscovered, containing a kitchen and supper room. Lockleys now features many large modern homes including one shown on the Grand Designs Television show. Sport Lockleys is home to the Lockleys Football Club, known as the Demons, their home clubrooms on Rutland Ave are a modern two-story facility that has won a state award for its architecture. The club play in the South Australian Amateur Football League. AFLW player Ebony Marinoff played for the club, as well as former AFL player Jimmy Toumpas and Brooklyn Park local and Port Power draftee Thomas Scully The Lockleys Football Club facilities are shared with the West Torrens Baseball Club. The South Australian Badminton Association is also located in Lockleys, neighbouring the football club and baseball club. The Kooyonga Golf Club is also located in Lockleys. Kooyonga was the name of the suburb before it became Lockleys. Government Lockleys is in the City of West Torrens local government area, split between the South Australian House of Assembly electoral district of Colton and electoral district of West Torrens, and in the Australian House of Representatives Division of Hindmarsh. Education Two schools are located in Lockleys – Lockleys North Primary School and St Francis School. Despite its name, Lockleys Primary School is located in neighbouring suburb Brooklyn Park. Lockleys North Primary School Lockleys North Primary School is a coeducational grades R-6 school located on Malurus Avenue. Students come from a wide variety of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds due to the demographics of West Torrens area. History With the expansion of the western suburbs of Adelaide the school was built in 1960. The school celebrated its 50th anniversary with an open day for old scholars and old staff on 14 November 2010. Facilities In July 2010, two new school buildings opened – \"Tirkandi\" (Library) and \"Torrens\" (classrooms for year 6-7's). The library was opened by Steve Georganas, the Member of Parliament for the seat of Hindmarsh. The school grounds also have a soccer pitch which have not only used by the school, but also local sporting clubs. The gymnasium has also been used for badminton by local sporting clubs. Special programs Specialist programs are offered in science, physical education, music, German and Greek. St Francis School St Francis School is a coeducational grades R-6 school located on Henley Beach Road. It is a private Catholic school.

{"text": "The Chrysostom Monastery () was a monastery in Moscow. It was consecrated to Saint John Chrysostom (Russian: Ivan Zlatoust). History The cloister to the east from the Kitai-gorod was first mentioned in 1412 when a Novgorod archdeacon was buried there. In 1478, Grand Prince Ivan III, who had a suburban palace nearby, had the wooden cathedral rebuilt in stone. When a Crimean Khan Devlet I Giray attacked Moscow in 1571, the monastery was burnt down. It was later restored, only to be damaged again in 1611 during the Time of Troubles. In 1660, Ivan III's stone cathedral burnt down and was replaced by a new five-domed cathedral, which survived into the 20th century. In 1706, the monastery hegumen was raised to the rank of archmandrite. In 1737, the Chrysostom Monastery was gutted by fire, but it would be restored in 1738–1740. The monastery subsisted owing to the donations from the noblemen who had their estates nearby, notably the Counts Apraksin and Rumyantsev. Some members of these families, particularly those who served in the Navy, were buried there: Matvei Apraksin, Fyodor Apraksin, Alexander Rumyantsev, Ivan Akimovich Senyavin. In 1742, Empress Elizabeth visited the Chrysostom Monastery and donated 2,000 rubles for the construction of the Church of Saint Elizabeth. In 1764, the monastery was granted an annual allowance of 806 rubles and 30 kopecks, which would be increased to 1460 rubles during the reign of Paul I. During the Patriotic War of 1812, the sacristy of the monastery was moved to Vologda. The monastery itself was damaged by the French and then restored in 1816. By 1907, there had been an archimandrite, 11 monks and 2 novices in the monastery. In the early 20th century, a parish school was opened on the grounds. In 1933, the buildings of the Chrysostom Monastery were dismantled by the Soviets under pretext of their dilapidation. On its place, a constructivist edifice was erected. The graves of the Russian naval leaders were desecrated. The monastic cells of the Chrysostom Monastery, built in 1862, can still be seen in Maly Zlatoustinsky Lane in Moscow.

{"text": "Thomas Alan Stephenson FRS (19 January 1898 – 3 April 1961) was a British naturalist, and marine biologist, specialising in sea anemones. Early life Thomas Alan Stephenson, who went by his middle name, was born on 19 January 1898 in Burnham-on-Sea in Surrey, England. He was the eldest of three born to Thomas Stephenson, a Wesleyan minister and amateur botanist, and Margaret Stephenson (née Fletcher); a brother and sister would follow. The first six years of Stephenson's life were spent in Richmond, Surrey, where his father was a tutor at Richmond Theological College; his mother's father was the college's governor. These years, according to his obituary, \"were the pleasantest in Alan Stephenson’s childhood\". As Stephenson later recalled, \"[w]e lived in the Governor’s well appointed house, and had the run of the large College grounds and kitchen-garden, so that we were brought up in all the surroundings and circumstances usual to gentlefolk of good education in the Edwardian period. We were surrounded by flower-gardens, had Richmond Park and the Terrace Gardens and river close at hand (not to mention all the rather more remote attractions of the London area), and were provided with an adequate staff of well trained nurse maids, servants and gardeners.\" In 1904, Stephenson's father left the college and assumed the traditional role of a Wesleyan minister: \"circuits,\" typically three years each, spent in different locations. These circuits began at Clapham, and included stints at (amongst many other locations) Wrexham, Timperley, and Aberystwyth. The frequent moves were difficult for Stephenson, whose education was inevitably fragmented, and who found it impossible to establish childhood friendships. Education Stephenson attended schools in both Clapham and Wrexham. Living in Wrexham introduced Stephenson to Harold Drinkwater, a physician and amateur botanist who was also a skilled painter. \"Dr Drinkwater\", Stephenson later wrote, \"was a remarkable man. Gifted in drawing, he made no special use of his ability until about the age of 60, when an interest in botany led him to begin painting a long series of portraits of British plants. For this purpose he invented a method of his own. Maintaining that a portrait of a plant looked very unnatural against a white background, he taught himself to paint it on rather rough sage-green paper, using Chinese white in the undercoats as a foundation for the brilliant colours of the overpainting. In a few years he produced a remarkable series of paintings, many of which are now in the National Museum of Wales at Cardiff. I was fortunate enough to know him during his most productive period, and he was more than kind to me. He allowed me to paint flowers with him, so that I learnt all he could teach; he took me on his rounds with him; he and his wife made me permanently welcome at their house; and he procured anatomical material for me through which I made my first acquaintance with human anatomy. This friendship was maintained as long as he lived, after my family left Wrexham.\" After Wrexham, Stephenson boarded at Kingswood School in Bath. Living in a 50-person dormitory and with few places to sit besides the library and classrooms, Stephenson eschewed school games in favor of long walks in the country. Stephenson's academic career was perhaps due only to the accident of his father's travels taking the family to Aberystwyth from 1914 to 1919. Stephenson matriculated at University College, Aberystwyth in October 1915, although his studies were interrupted by illness: tubercular infections of abdominal and cervical glands which later involved the appendix, requiring an operation and time in a sanatorium. This meant an atypical college experience, involving both coursework and private instruction. Stephenson came under the particular wing of the zoologist and geographer H. J. Fleure, a \"unique and remarkable man\", in Stephenson's words, who \"encouraged me unflaggingly from the start\". Fleure nurtured Stephenson's already-developing interest in sea anemones, and saw him appointed as student-demonstrator in 1916. Fleur also facilitated access for Stephenson to the sea anemones collected during the 1910–1913 Terra Nova Expedition to Antarctica, and directed Stephenson's study of them. This resulted in the first of several articles on the subject, published when Stephenson was 20. In 1920 and with Fleure's backing, Stephenson was permitted to obtain a Master of Science on the strength of his publications. From 1920 to 1922 or 1923, Stephenson undertook research work at Aberystwyth, backed by a grant from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Stephenson also began collaborating with his father on a series of papers on orchids. The two coauthored more than 20 papers and notes between 1920 and 1926. Much of this work focused on the genera Epipactis and Dactylorhiza. \"Perhaps their most important single contribution\", according to V. S. Summerhayes, the botanist in charge of the orchid herbarium at Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, \"was their recognition and definition of Orchis purpurella\"—now Dactylorhiza purpurella—\"which is now known as a widely spread member of the British flora\". Another contribution was to recognize the distinction between the variants Epipactis dunensis (now recognized as a species) and Epipactis phyllanthes var. vectensis. In 1923 and again with Fleure's backing, Stephenson obtained a Doctor of Science in the same way he obtained his Masters; the publications submitted in support of his degree included those on both sea anemones and orchids. Career In 1922 or 1923, Stephenson was appointed lecturer in zoology at University College, London. Stephenson's work on orchids and sea anemones continued, and in 1928, he published the first of two volumes of The British Sea Anemones. Work on the second volume would be delayed, however, for that same year, Stephenson joined the 1928 Great Barrier Reef expedition at the invitation of Maurice Yonge, the expedition's leader. Stephenson was \"an obvious choice\", Yonge later wrote, given \"his intimate acquaintance with the group of animals most closely allied to the madreporarian corals and his intense interest in marine biology\". Stephenson held a number of academic posts in Britain, and at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. His final position was that of Professor and Head of the Department of Zoology at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. The National Marine Biological Library at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth hold some of his personal and scientific records, including paintings, negatives and notebooks on South Africa. Personal life Stephenson married Anne Wood in 1922. She was the younger of twin sisters born to Joseph Dore Wood, the secretary for the Barry Graving Dock and Engineering Company, which built the south Wales docks, and Anna Eliza Wood. The Stephensons had no children. Publications Books Bound copy held by the National Art Library, along with photographs intended as plates.

{"text": "In numerical methods, total variation diminishing (TVD) is a property of certain discretization schemes used to solve hyperbolic partial differential equations. The most notable application of this method is in computational fluid dynamics. The concept of TVD was introduced by Ami Harten. Model equation In systems described by partial differential equations, such as the following hyperbolic advection equation, the total variation (TV) is given by and the total variation for the discrete case is, where . A numerical method is said to be total variation diminishing (TVD) if, Characteristics A numerical scheme is said to be monotonicity preserving if the following properties are maintained: If is monotonically increasing (or decreasing) in space, then so is . proved the following properties for a numerical scheme, A monotone scheme is TVD, and A TVD scheme is monotonicity preserving. Application in CFD In Computational Fluid Dynamics, TVD scheme is employed to capture sharper shock predictions without any misleading oscillations when variation of field variable “” is discontinuous. To capture the variation fine grids ( very small) are needed and the computation becomes heavy and therefore uneconomic. The use of coarse grids with central difference scheme, upwind scheme, hybrid difference scheme, and power law scheme gives false shock predictions. TVD scheme enables sharper shock predictions on coarse grids saving computation time and as the scheme preserves monotonicity there are no spurious oscillations in the solution. Discretisation Consider the steady state one-dimensional convection diffusion equation, , where is the density, is the velocity vector, is the property being transported, is the coefficient of diffusion and is the source term responsible for generation of the property . Making the flux balance of this property about a control volume we get, Here is the normal to the surface of control volume. Ignoring the source term, the equation further reduces to: Assuming and The equation reduces to Say, From the figure: The equation becomes: The continuity equation also has to be satisfied in one of its equivalent forms for this problem: Assuming diffusivity is a homogeneous property and equal grid spacing we can say we getThe equation further reduces toThe equation above can be written aswhere is the Péclet number TVD scheme Total variation diminishing scheme makes an assumption for the values of and to be substituted in the discretized equation as follows: Where is the Péclet number and is the weighing function to be determined from, where refers to upstream, refers to upstream of and refers to downstream. Note that is the weighing function when the flow is in positive direction (i.e., from left to right) and is the weighing function when the flow is in the negative direction from right to left. So, If the flow is in positive direction then, Péclet number is positive and the term , so the function won't play any role in the assumption of and . Likewise when the flow is in negative direction, is negative and the term , so the function won't play any role in the assumption of and . It therefore takes into account the values of property depending on the direction of flow and using the weighted functions tries to achieve monotonicity in the solution thereby producing results with no spurious shocks. Limitations Monotone schemes are attractive for solving engineering and scientific problems because they do not produce non-physical solutions. Godunov's theorem proves that linear schemes which preserve monotonicity are, at most, only first order accurate. Higher order linear schemes, although more accurate for smooth solutions, are not TVD and tend to introduce spurious oscillations (wiggles) where discontinuities or shocks arise. To overcome these drawbacks, various high-resolution, non-linear techniques have been developed, often using flux/slope limiters.

{"text": "Reginald Campbell (1894–1950) was a British writer and former Naval officer in WWI then an assistant forest manager in Siam in the 1920s. His novel Poo Lorn of the Elephants was filmed by Alejandro Jodorowsky in 1980 under the name Tusk. Another novel, Tiger Valley, was filmed in 1936 by Howard Bretherton as The Girl from Mandalay. He described his personal experiences from Thailand in the book Teak-Wallah: The Adventures of a Young Englishman in Thailand in the 1920s. In his book Teak Wallah, he describes a character called Smith, his assistant in Muang Ngow - Flight Lieutenant 'Dick' Frederick Murison, who almost died from fever in the teak jungle and later served as a bomber pilot in Afghanistan in the late 20s. Orwell may be Mr. W. Elder, Forest Manager of Anglo-Siam Forest Company, a heroic figure who lived amongst the elephants of Muang Ngow near Lakon (in the book Nakon) and retired in Riverhead, Kent dying in about 1935. He gives a fairly accurate appraisal of life as an assistant forest manager with its dangers from disease and wild animals while logging teak with elephants. Campbell also wrote a book about an elephant breeder and trader in Siam in the 1920s called \"Jungle Nights.\" The rapturous conclusion is a full-on Roman-style elephant charge in phalanx formation against the evil Mongol elephant trader who is stampeding a wild herd into his compound that is unintentionally hilarious. Tubby Kenson's character (a bumbling teak wallah who the hero, Jim Dales (Reggie), takes the gal, Pat Bell from) may be based partly on Fred Murison, to whom Reggie handed his signed book in Dec 1934. Fred was not impressed. This book is out of print and rare. He wrote \"Cruiser In Action\" about his Naval experiences. 'Fear in the Forest' is more jungle stuff. Works Note: non-exhaustive list.

{"text": "Ras malai, also known as rosomalai, or roshmalai, is a dessert from the Indian subcontinent. The dessert is called roshmalai/rosmalai in Bengali, ras malai in Hindi, and rasa malei in Odia. It is popular in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The origin of the sweet is impossible to verify but there are alternate stories identifying an origin in the Bengal region, possibly Kolkata, West Bengal, India or Comilla, Bangladesh by Bengali Hindus. Origin and etymology Ras malai is believed to have originated somewhere in Eastern Indian subcontinent, specifically in the Bengal region. The Sen brothers of Comilla operating under the Matri Bhandar brand are believed to be the original maker of the dessert. On the other hand, K.C. Das Grandsons claims that it was invented by K.C. Das in Kolkata. Bangladesh has begun the process of registering geographical indication status for Comillar ras malai. According to The Diner's Dictionary: Word Origins of Food and Drink published by Oxford University Press \"The term comes from Hindi raś 'juice', and malai 'cream'. Ingredients Ras malai consists of flattened balls of chhena soaked in malai (a type of clotted cream) flavoured with cardamom. Milk is boiled and a bit of vinegar or lime juice is added to split it. The whey is discarded and the milk solids are drained, cooled and kneaded into a dough. The dough is divided into small balls and the balls are cooked in hot water with a bit of rose water added. The balls are then cooked in milk with saffron, pistachios and kheer as stuffing. Variations Different types of ras malai can be found in different areas such Rasmanjuri of Rangpur division. In Dhaka and Rangpur, the ras malais are similar in shape to the rasgullas, and round discs.

{"text": "William Charles \"Diz\" Disley (27 May 1931 – 22 March 2010) was an Anglo-Canadian jazz guitarist and banjoist. He is best known for his acoustic jazz guitar playing, strongly influenced by Django Reinhardt, for his contributions to the UK trad jazz, skiffle and folk scenes as a performer and humorist, and for his collaborations with the violinist Stéphane Grappelli. Biography Early life William Charles Disley was born, to Welsh parents then overseas for work, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. When he was four, his parents moved back to Llandyssil in Montgomeryshire in Wales and then five years later to Ingleton, North Yorkshire, England, where his mother worked as schoolteacher. In his childhood, he learned to play the banjo, but took up jazz guitar at the age of 15, after being exposed to the playing of Django Reinhardt. As Disley recalled, his neighbour Norry Greenwood taught him the chords to \"Miss Annabel Lee\" and \"Try a Little Tenderness\" in the summer of 1946. Disley showed an early gift for drawing. On leaving school he enrolled at Leeds College of Art, a college with a reputation for student music making, in particular trad jazz, and was soon playing in the Vernon City Ramblers and the Yorkshire Jazz Band, with trumpeter Dick Hawdon and clarinettist Alan Cooper. Disley did his National Service overseas in the Army from 1950–1953, after which he resumed his studies in Leeds, and began selling cartoons to national newspapers and periodicals. In 1953 he worked for a summer season in Morecambe, Lancashire, as part of the comedy harmony group The Godfrey Brothers, still playing banjo. He moved to London and joined Mick Mulligan's band with George Melly. Melly described him as having \"a beard and [...] the face of a satyr en route to a cheerful orgy\". He worked with most of the trad jazz bands of the day, including those of Ken Colyer, Cy Laurie, Sandy Brown, Kenny Ball, and Alex Welsh. He played banjo and occasionally guitar. His first love remained the music of Django Reinhardt, in particular the sound of the pre-war Quintette du Hot Club de France. In 1958, he formed a quintet to replicate that sound, employing Dick Powell on violin, Danny Pursford and Nevil Skrimshire on rhythm guitars, and a range of double bassists including Tim Mahn. As skiffle dominated traditional jazz in popular culture in the UK, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Disley started working as guitarist with a number of skiffle groups, including those of Ken Colyer, Lonnie Donegan, Bob Cort and Nancy Whiskey, and performed on numerous recordings. With Ike Isaacs he appeared on Ken Sykora's Guitar Club on BBC Radio for a number of years and was voted second best (1960) and best (1961) British jazz guitarist in the UK Melody Maker jazz polls. In January 1963, the British music magazine, NME reported that the biggest trad jazz event to be staged in Britain had taken place at Alexandra Palace. The event included George Melly, Alex Welsh, Acker Bilk, Chris Barber, Kenny Ball, Ken Colyer, Monty Sunshine, Bob Wallis, Bruce Turner, Mick Mulligan, and Disley. That same year Diz played the conductor in the Harrison Marks film The Chimney Sweeps (1963), a slapstick comedy starring Pamela Green. Folk club performer and humorist In the early to mid 1960s, the \"trad\" and skiffle booms were coming to an end and Disley moved across to the emerging folk club scene, developing a new persona as an entertainer/musical comedian with an act based on songs from trad jazz and the British music hall and other humorous ditties accompanied by lightly swinging guitar, monologues in the manner of Stanley Holloway (especially those penned by Marriott Edgar), banter with the audience, and a string of one-line jokes in the manner of W. C. Fields and Groucho Marx, always finding room at the end of the evening for some hot-club-style guitar instrumentals, often with the assistance of some unsuspecting second guitarist invited up from the audience. He was also employed by the BBC as compere for a number of shows, including introducing The Beatles on their first London concert. As arguably the \"folk world\"'s then most competent performer in the area of jazzy guitar accompaniment he collaborated with fiddle player Dave Swarbrick on several ragtime tunes the 1967 Dave Swarbrick album, Rags, Reels & Airs, along with singer-guitarist Martin Carthy on the more folk-based material. Disley also played guitar accompaniment to Mike Absalom on the latter's 1968 album, Save the Last Gherkin for Me. By the 1970s, he was one of the folk scene's busiest artists and a mainstay of folk festivals as musician and compere. Back to jazz with Stephane Grappelli In 1973, he was influential in persuading Quintette du Hot Club de France violinist Stéphane Grappelli to return to public performances using an all-strings acoustic line-up, recreating the spirit of the Quintette for a new generation of listeners. Before this, Grappelli had spent a number of years playing \"cocktail jazz\" in a Paris hotel. After a couple of \"warm up\" gigs in small folk clubs, they played together to an unexpectedly warm reception at the 1973 Cambridge Folk Festival with Denny Wright on second acoustic guitar. This began a collaboration between Grappelli and the Diz Disley Trio, sometimes billed The Hot Club of London, with tours of Australia, Europe, and the United States. Karl Dallas reported Disley as having \"single-handedly created a revival of interest in the music of Stephane Grappelli, which has taken him to Carnegie Hall, Australia, and New Zealand\" (the latter in September 1974). \"...the night he closed at the Palladium, he went to The Troubadour where he was booked later that night to perform his folk club act of idiocy and mayhem, keeping up the tradition he has built up over the past 20 years for delivering a shrewd mixture of musical brilliance and vocal insanity.\" There were a few changes in line-up with Ike Isaacs, Louis Stewart, and John Etheridge alternating as second guitarist. The Disley Trio accompanied Grappelli for another five years until Disley was forced to take a break in 1979 after breaking his wrist when he was knocked down by a motorcycle in London. His replacement was a young Martin Taylor, who toured with Grappelli for ten years. During that period, Disley continued to play folk clubs and festivals as a solo performer and also mentored a young Chris Newman, who would establish his own name in the swing jazz, guitar flatpicking and celtic folk guitar fields. In 1978 Grappelli, Disley, and others were invited by David Grisman to contribute the score to the film King of the Gypsies. Grappelli and Disley had walk-on parts as gypsy musicians and were suitably attired for the occasion, but the soundtrack to the movie was never released. Disley was back with Grappelli in 1981–2 with a visit to the U.S. which resulted in parts of two performances captured on film, later released as Stéphane Grappelli - Live in San Francisco although the two musicians parted ways soon after, this time for good. For the second concert performance (filmed at the Great American Music Hall), Grappelli and the Trio were joined for an encore by David Grisman, Darol Anger, Mike Marshall, and Rob Wasserman for a performance of \"Sweet Georgia Brown\". After Grappelli In the early 1980s Disley formed a working partnership with gypsy jazz guitar prodigy Bireli Lagrene, with whom he again toured the world, including a return visit to Carnegie Hall. In 1984 Disley was instrumental in forming a club quintet for Nigel Kennedy, who was starting to explore other musical styles. Musicians with Kennedy were Jeff Green, Ian Cruickshank, Nils Solberg (guitars), and Dave Etheridge (bass), who had played with Disley and Denny Wright on their 1973 tour with Grappelli. In 1986, Disley formed the Soho String Quintette with Johnny Van Derrick (violin), Nils Solberg, Jeff Green, and David Etheridge. Zing Went the Strings was issued by Waterfront Records. In the 1990s, during several years spent in Los Angeles, Disley recorded with blues saxophonist Big Jay McNeely and country-rockabilly musician Ray Campi. He painted several portraits of jazz musicians, including Illinois Jacquet, in the style of the Cubists. In the 2000s he spent time in Spain, where he had purchased land with the stated intention of building a golf course. He ran a jazz bar there between trips to the UK for continued performances. In early 2010 Disley's health took a turn for the worse, and he was admitted to the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, England, on 2 February. He died on 21 March 2010. Guitar style Disley's style was frequently compared to Django Reinhardt's, particularly the single-string soloing. But he was also influenced by plectrum-style players such as Eddie Lang, Lonnie Johnson, and Teddy Bunn, During the early part of his career, Disley developed an accompaniment style that incorporated complex and subtle jazz harmonies, the ability to play in any key anywhere on the instrument, including traditionally \"non guitar-friendly\" keys such as B flat and E flat, the choice of numerous alternate voicings for any chord, plus the incorporation of moving figures in the bassline and internal notes of chords. Although much of Disley's playing in this respect remains undocumented from his folk club years except for a few amateur recordings, the two tracks on Dave Swarbrick's Rags, Reels & Airs album give an indication of his swinging accompaniment. Much better documented are the years of Disley's association with Grappelli. His rhythm playing is notable for the lightness and propulsion engendered by his right hand technique while using Selmer/Maccaferri-style instruments noted for their projection and bright open tone, as well as choice of appropriate chord voicings. His contributions are most easily discernible in the solo introductions to certain swing tunes and in acoustic guitar solos backed by the other rhythm guitar and double bass. Anecdotes and personal reminiscences Disley was very much a one-off \"character\" and remembered for his personality traits and eccentricities. Contributors talk of his chaotic life. He had the ability to make large sums of money and then be completely penniless. He drove and slept in a Rolls-Royce hearse with a sack of carrots and a juicer, believing that carrot juice would offset the effects of alcohol. He arrived at clubs and discovered he got the week of his performance wrong. He frequently arrived at folk clubs without his guitar, borrowing one from the audience, upon which he would play quite unaffected by any instrumental inadequacies. He addressed most people he met as \"Dear Boy\". His most frequent request was for an advance on his fee or to cash a check for the same purpose, which he would refer to in slang as \"sausage me a gregory\": sausage and mash for \"cash\", Gregory Peck for \"check\". David \"Brillo\" Etheridge (double bass) and Chris Newman (guitar) have spoken highly of his mentoring and sharing of his musical knowledge at formative stages in their careers.

{"text": "Brad Izzard (born 6 May 1962 in Blacktown, New South Wales) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s and 1990s. He played for the Penrith Panthers in the New South Wales Rugby League competition in Australia as well as playing four games for the New South Wales State of Origin side. His position of choice was at centre. He is the brother of Scott, Craig and Grant Izzard. Playing career Izzard was a local junior for Penrith making his first grade debut for the club in the 1982 season. Izzard was called up to the New South Wales side in game one of State of Origin in his debut year playing on the wing though injury ruled him out of the remaining matches for his state and country played that year. Fitness problems went on to hamper his relationship with several of his coaches such as Tim Sheens and Ron Willey but playing under Phil Gould in 1991 his efforts on the field became instrumental in his team's success helping them to a grand final premiership victory. Following the grand final victory he travelled with the Panthers to England for the 1991 World Club Challenge which was lost to Wigan. The following season several neck injuries reduced the amount of time he was able to play eventually having to retire when it was revealed it was a chronic problem. At the time of his retirement in 1992 until Greg Alexander surpassed him in the 1998 season, he was the second most capped Penrith Panthers player behind Royce Simmons. He currently ranks at 7th.

{"text": "The Taregh () is a class of fast patrol boat used by naval forces of Iran. A Boghammar is a High Speed Patrol Boat for use in coastal patrol. The term Boghammar originated from the Iranian patrol boats manufactured by the Swedish company Boghammar Marin AB during the 1980s used in the Iran–Iraq War and its Tanker War. History In 1983, Iran purchased 50 RL-118 and RL-130 patrol crafts from Boghammar Marin AB for reportedly $10 million. It was the biggest order ever for the shipyard, and was worth almost three times their annual revenues. By February 1987, The Washington Post reported that the newly established Navy of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps began using the boats. According to Svenska Dagbladet, American authorities maintained that Iran acquired at least a further 13 boats by way of Czechoslovakia. Wider use The term boghammar, sometimes spelled boghammer, has also come to mean an improvised naval fighting vessel, typically used by a local irregular military force and usually being a modified civilian boat or other similar machine. It is usually a speedboat or fast patrol boat (as used by police for harbor/river patrol) on which are mounted recoilless rifles, heavy machine guns, mortars, or other relatively small weapons systems. A boghammar is usually unarmoured. Boghammars, in this sense, have been used by paramilitary forces to attack offshore oil platforms and civilian shipping, or even larger military vessels, most notably by Iran in the Tanker War. Other users of such vessels include Nigerian militants, LTTE Sea Tigers, and Somali pirates.

{"text": "The New Centurions (1971), is a novel by American writer Joseph Wambaugh. It explores the stresses of police work in Los Angeles, California, in the early 1960s. The author wrote the novel, his first, while he was still a working member of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). The novel was adapted as a film of the same name starring George C. Scott and Stacy Keach. Plot summary The novel is basically without plot, instead episodically depicting the psychological changes in three LAPD officers caused by their police work, and particularly the nature of police work in poor minority communities of Los Angeles. The three officers, Serge Duran, Gus Plebesly, and Roy Fehler, are classmates at the police academy in the summer of 1960, and the novel examines their lives each August of succeeding years, culminating in their on-the-job reunion during the Watts riots of August 1965. The New Centurions is likely the most autobiographical of Wambaugh's novels. He provides a straightforward narration of events with little use of flashback. Each chapter is written in the third person from the point of view of one of the three protagonists. They have no contact with each other once they graduate from the academy, but their paths are similar and converging. Like Wambaugh, his protagonists move from a few years of uniformed patrol in minority districts to plainclothes assignments in juvenile and vice work, experiences which so affected Wambaugh that he returns to them repeatedly as plot elements in his fiction. Wambaugh also explores the officers' private lives, noting adultery, alcoholism, racism, and suicide as rampant in the ranks of the LAPD. Police suicide, in particular, is a theme Wambaugh explores in nearly all of his books. A major theme explored throughout the book is what traits characterize a veteran officer, and how a rookie acquires them. Wambaugh consistently compares the attitudes of the new officers (one is not considered a veteran in the LAPD until one's fifth anniversary on the job) to those of the older entrenched men. Character synopsis Serge Duran Like Wambaugh, Duran came to the LAPD from the U.S. Marines, joining in 1954 right out of high school. Although Duran is a Chicano, he is described as having fair features and being tall. He speaks little Spanish. His first assignment is as uniformed patrol in Hollenbeck Division in East LA, and he resentfully notices that all the Chicanos in his class have been sent there. Duran is soon forced to confront his ethnicity, which he has hidden since leaving Chino to join the Marines. At first, he rationalizes why he does not want to be taken as Hispanic, but is increasingly uncomfortable with his self-denial. While working Hollywood Division for a few months in 1962 before returning to Hollenbeck, Duran begins to see East LA in a new light, as a comfortable place where people are what they seem to be. Teamed with an older but passive and unambitious officer after his return, Duran is pleased to learn that his patrol partner recommended him for a detective position investigating felonies in the Chicano division. Duran settles into a routine in Hollenbeck, goes through relatively meaningless personal relationships, and becomes a Juvenile Division detective to avoid a transfer and to improve his resumé. Wambaugh places much of the narrative around Duran in Mexican restaurants. In his favorite diner, Duran falls in love with the young Mexican waitress Mariana Paloma, who finally brings him to come to grips with his ethnicity. Of the three central characters, Duran is the least complex and well-delineated, possibly reflecting Wambaugh's difficulty in conveying ethnicity. Duran has the most vivid episodes in the novel's climax. He appears to be the character whom Wambaugh chooses to re-enact events that Wambaugh had undergone. Gus Plebesly Plebesly is middle class and suburban in upbringing, from Azusa. He married young and at 22 has two children. He worked in a bank before joining the LAPD, has earned a few college credits, but sought a job with higher status and better pay. Short and slim, Plebesly just passed the height and weight minima required of applicants, but is a natural athlete and a distance runner. His first assignment tests his hidden fear of being a coward. Although he performed well in both physical training and defensive tactics at the academy, Plebesly is doubtful of his ability to defeat an opponent in a physical confrontation. His assignment to University Division (now LAPD's \"Southwest Area\") intensifies his fears. University is more than 90% black in population and has a high crime rate, both conditions outside his experience. Plebesly is fortunate in that his first partner is the thoughtful and pragmatic veteran Andy Kilvinsky. He is featured only briefly, but is a crucial character. Close to retirement (which he refers to as \"pulling the pin\"), Klivinsky takes Plebesly under his wing to make into an extension of himself. He gives Plebesly a cram course in being a good cop, overcoming his self-doubts, and trusting his innate common sense. He warns Plebesly that the intensity of crime in University makes a year there the equivalent of 10 years in any other. Always offering insights from his personal philosophy, Kilvinsky likens the role of LAPD cops to that of centurions during the early decline of the Roman Empire, but Kilvinsky also represents a warning, as he has focused on work, and long-divorced, not just from his wife but the rest of his family, as well. After two years, Plebesly becomes a veteran, breaking in new rookies using the words and examples of Kilvinsky, now retired and living alone in Oregon. University Division has become more tense and dangerous than ever and the center of Black Muslim challenges to white authority. Plebesly has observed decent young officers like Rantlee becoming racist, apparently helpless to stop their changes. He can absorb what he witnesses, but does not fall subject to the same bias. Feeling he married too young, he feels trapped in his marriage. The frequency of divorce among his peers bothers him, and when he takes an interest in another woman, his female partner in Juvenile Division, fate intervenes in the form of Kilvinsky's suicide. Plebesly learns about this indirectly, after his former partner's will goes through probate. Roy Fehler Fehler, also married, dropped out of college out of boredom. Fehler had wandered into an academic major of criminology, but had grown tired of college studies and joined the LAPD on the pretext of gaining several years' firsthand experience about crime and criminals. With little interest in the semi-military aspects of the police environment, firearms, or physical training, Fehler from the outset views himself as intellectually superior to his fellow cadets, and later the officers with whom he works. Assigned to Newton Division, the poorest all-black division in the department, Fehler, like Plebesly, is also paired with a veteran officer nearing retirement, but the two experiences seemingly could not be more different. Whitey Duncan is an alcoholic, and as Fehler soon discovers, and drinks on the job from bottles concealed inside police callboxes. He exhibits an unpretentious street wisdom, though, that Fehler, in his conceit and scorn for Whitey, misses entirely. Roy, who has considered himself reasonable and thoughtful in all respects that his peers are not, develops a negative attitude toward the department's bureaucratic indifference that rivals that of any 20-year veteran. Fehler experiences a mutual but mild dislike with all his partners, who vary from night to night, and his marriage quickly disintegrates after the birth of his daughter Becky, who becomes the one brightness in an otherwise bleak existence. After two years in Newton, he seemingly escapes to work Vice in downtown Central Division, but it is only a reprieve. He is sent to Seventy-Seventh Division (Watts), considered a virtual war zone in the LAPD, and in Fehler's mind, 10 times as bad as Newton. The transfer only deepens his cynicism and resentment. Distracted by a psychologically traumatic call concerning an abused infant, Fehler and his partner interrupt the robbery of a liquor store in the immediate aftermath of the call. Fehler is careless and is shot in the stomach by a blast from a sawed-off shotgun. He survives, but his long, painful recovery is as traumatizing as the injury. The wound is slow to heal, Fehler endures a colostomy, and he is forced to live with his parents, where his job and injury are scorned and ridiculed. Worst of all, when he finally returns to full duty, it is back to patrol in Seventy-Seventh. Deluding himself that he had avoided a dependency on drugs, Fehler begins drinking, hiding bottles in both the trunk of his car and in callboxes. Just 26 years of age, Roy Fehler has devolved into Whitey Duncan. Returning to college studies has become all but forgotten, and he reaches bottom when he is suspended for 60 days without pay for drinking on duty. Fehler's redemption begins when he takes a burglary report from a young black dental technician, Laura Hunt, and becomes infatuated with her. They fall in love and he moves in with her during his suspension, where she \"dries him out\". Rid of his arrogance and conceit, Roy believes he is finally \"finding peace\" with himself. The Watts riots Wambaugh tightly controls his narrative of the Watts riots, which provides the backdrop for the novel's sixth and final part. He participated in it personally as an officer. He gives a harrowing account from the perspectives of his three main characters. At the end, however, it is not violence on a large scale that has the most effect on the lives of the three officers, but an unexpected act of personal violence, small in scale by comparison. In the first chapter, the longest, the riot is revealed through the anxiety of Serge Duran, being held at Hollenbeck and waiting to have to enter it. Later, the nervous conversations of three officers thrown together in a radio car reveal aspects of the riot. They do not know where they are or what they should be doing. Leaderless, they finally fall in with a small collection of officers gathered by a sergeant and put down the looting in just one store on one block. They are stunned to realize that this show of authority is enough to \"quell\" most of the rioters in the area, some of whom are children. On his way home that night, Duran stops to eat. He orders menudo, a soup which has always represented his Chicano background, and finally identifies as Hispanic. In the second chapter, the shortest, Gus Plebesly and his temporary partners arrive at the same decision. Plebesly is sitting in the back seat, fearful of what tests lie ahead, but suddenly they confront a crowd trying to set fire to a grocery. The police interrupt them and chase them. Plebesly finally runs down not just one, but three rioters, arresting them one at a time until he confronts the last. This man is much larger and more muscular than he, but he subdues him convincingly. Afterward, Plebesly is still afraid and sometimes almost as panic-stricken as before, but he learns he can endure. Roy Fehler, in the third and next-to-last chapter, does little but observe. For half the chapter, he is pinned down behind a fire engine by a sniper, protecting his stomach from further injury and reflecting that even in the chaos of South Central Los Angeles, he has found peace in his life by being with Laura. A sergeant galvanizes the disorganized police remnants into action, but the night ends with an ugly incident. Roy's crew gets into a vehicle pursuit of looters, is almost machine-gunned at a National Guard roadblock, and then crash, looters escape when their car crashes. One of Roy's temporary partners shoots up the car and sets it afire. Soon after, Roy goes home to Laura. He rejects her offer of a drink and her apology about the riot (she is black). Roy soaks in a hot bath, and finally relaxed, asks Laura to marry him. Adaptations In 1972, The New Centurions was adapted as a feature film released by Columbia Pictures, starring George C. Scott as Andy Kilvinsky and Stacy Keach as Roy Fehler. Columbia paid Wambaugh a bonus of $1,250.00 for each week the novel remained on the New York Times Best Seller list. Ultimately the novel, which first appeared on the list on February 21, 1971, remained on it for 32 weeks.

{"text": "Hemeroplanes triptolemus is a moth of the family Sphingidae. Description Biology Its chest and wings are covered in scales. The moth uses a proboscis to feed itself nectar. Both males and females have a relatively long lifetime of 10 to 30 days. The female moths lay pellucid green eggs. Egg growth varies strongly from 3 to 21 days. There are at least two generations per year with peak flights from January to February and again from June to July. The larvae feed on Mesechites trifida. In its larval form, the Hemeroplanes triptolemus is capable of expanding its anterior body segments to give it the appearance of a snake, complete with eye patches. This snake mimicry extends even to the point where it will harmlessly strike at potential predators. Distribution The moth is known from Costa Rica, Belize, Mexico, Guatemala and probably flies throughout Central America into Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Argentina, Venezuela and Guyana.

{"text": "The 130th (Devon & Cornwall) Brigade, originally the Plymouth Brigade was an infantry formation of Britain's Volunteer Force, Territorial Force, and later Territorial Army (TA). In the First World War the brigade was in British India for most of the war and did not see service as a complete formation, but many of its battalions fought in the Middle East campaigns. The brigade (without its Devon or Cornwall battalions) did see action during the campaign in North West Europe of the Second World War, distinguishing itself at actions such as Operation Jupiter (Hill 112), the capture of Mont Pinçon, Operation Market Garden, at 'Dorset Wood' and at Hengelo. As 130 (West Country) Brigade it continued in the postwar TA until 1961. Volunteer Force The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 proposed a comprehensive Mobilisation Scheme for the part-time Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these Volunteer Infantry Brigades provided a structure for collective training. On 9 February 1889 Lieutenant-Colonel the Earl Mount Edgcumbe, commanding officer (CO) of the 2nd (Prince of Wales's) Volunteer Battalion, Devonshire Regiment, was appointed Colonel in command of the Plymouth Brigade, consisting of the volunteer battalions of the Devonsand the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (DCLI), which was charged with defending the Royal Navy's base at Plymouth. The brigade commander was assisted by a retired Regular officer acting as Brigade major. Later staff appointments were filled by officers from the volunteer battalions. Lord Mount Edgcumbe commanded the Plymouth Brigade until 1893; he was succeeded as Colonel Commandant by a retired Regular officer, Major-General M.A.H.J. Heriot. By 1895 the Plymouth Brigade had the following organisation: Headquarters (HQ): Ivybridge Brigade Commander: Maj-Gen M.A.H.J. Heriot Aide-de-camp: Captain E.C. Nicholetts, 3rd VB Devons Brigade Major: Major (retired) F.M. Eden Supply and Transport Officer: Maj L.E. Beare, VD, 5th VB Devons Brigade Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel: D. Thompson, 2nd VB DCLI 1st (Exeter and South Devon) Volunteer Battalion, Devonshire Regiment 2nd (Prince of Wales's) Volunteer Battalion, Devonshire Regiment 3rd Volunteer Battalion, Devonshire Regiment 4th Volunteer Battalion, Devonshire Regiment 5th (The Hay Tor) Volunteer Battalion, Devonshire Regiment 1st (Duke of Cornwall's) Volunteer Battalion, DCLI 2nd (Duke of Cornwall's) Volunteer Battalion, DCLI Supply Detachment, later designated an Army Service Corps (ASC) Company Bearer Company, later part of the Royal Army Medical Corps Lewis, 9th Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, VD, the CO of the 5th (Hay Tor) VB, Devons, took command of the Plymouth Brigade as a Temporary Colonel in 1901, and shortly afterwards it was renamed the Devonshire Brigade when the HQ moved to Exeter and the two DCLI battalions transferred to the Cornwall & Somerset Brigade (also headquartered at Exeter). Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908, the brigade carried on as the Devon and Cornwall Brigade in the TF's Wessex Division. Lord Clifford continued in command and retained the temporary rank of colonel. The reorganised brigade had the following composition: HQ: Lennard Buildings, Goldsmith Street, Exeter 4th Bn Devonshire Regiment (from the former 1st & 3rd VBs) at Exeter 5th (Prince of Wales's) Bn Devonshire Regiment (from the 2nd & 5th VBs) at Plymouth 4th Bn Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (from the 1st VB) at Truro 5th Bn Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (from the 2nd VB) at Bodmin No 2 (Devon & Cornwall) Section, Wessex Divisional Signal Company, Royal Engineers Devon & Cornwall Brigade Company, ASC, at Mutley Barracks, Exeter The 6th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment, (from the 4thVB) at Barnstaple was not part of the brigade, but was designated as 'Army Troops' attached to the Wessex Division. First World War On 29 July 1914 the Wessex Division was on Salisbury Plain carrying out its annual training camp when 'precautionary orders' were received, and next day the division took up emergency war stations in Somerset, Devon and Cornwall. The order to mobilise arrived on the evening of 4 August. Between 10 and 13 August the division concentrated on Salisbury Plain and began war training. On the outbreak of war, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service and on 15 August the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry experienced a shortfall in volunteers, and so many Overseas Service men had to be transferred from the 1/5th DCLI to bring the 1/4th up to strength that the 1/5th was withdrawn from the Devon & Cornwall brigade and replaced by the 1/6th Devons on 16 September; 1/5th DCLI later became a pioneer battalion on the Western Front. On 24 September, at the special request of the Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, the Wessex Division accepted liability for service in British India to relieve the Regular units there for service on the Western Front. The division's infantry battalions (without their brigade headquarters) embarked at Southampton on 8 October and the were convoyed to Karachi (the Devon battalions) and Bombay (1/4th DCLI). They were immediately distributed to garrisons across India, reverting to peacetime service conditions, and the Devon & Cornwall Brigade never saw service as a whole, though it was formally numbered the 130th (Devon and Cornwall) Brigade in May 1915. As soon as the Wessex Division had left for India, the 2nd Wessex Division and its brigades began to be organised from the 2nd Line battalions being raised by the home depots. Recruitment and training of the 2nd Wessex Division proceeded so well that it was also sent to India in December 1914, and later received the notional titles of 45th (2nd Wessex) Division and 136th (2/1st Devon and Cornwall) Brigade. Brigadier-General R.J. Pinney, who had commanded the Devon & Cornwall Brigade since 16 July 1913, took temporary command of the 2nd Wessex Division on its formation and Brig-Gen Lord St Levan (a retired colonel in the Grenadier Guards) commanded the 2/1st Devon and Cornwall Brigade until it embarked for India. By early 1915 the need was growing for troops to be sent from India to various theatres of war, and the first drafts and formed units from the Wessex Divisions began to go on active service, particularly to the Mesopotamian Front. By the end of the war only one battalion remained in India from the two Devon & Cornwall brigades. Interwar The TF (reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921) began to reform on 7 February 1920. 130th (Devon and Cornwall) Infantry Brigade in 43rd (Wessex) Division was composed as follows: 4th Bn Devons 5th Bn Devons 6th Bn Devons 4th/5th Bn DCLI (amalgamated 1921) Second World War Mobilisation After the Munich Crisis in late 1938, when the possibility of another European conflict loomed, the TA was doubled in size, and once again its units formed duplicates. The TA's infantry units mobilised on 1 September 1939, two days before war was declared. At the time of mobilisation the duplicate 45th Division was still being organised, so both 1st and 2nd Line units were administered by 43rd (Wessex) Division HQ. Once the two were separated, the Devon and DCLI battalions were all assigned to 45th Division and 130th Infantry Brigade (the 'Devon and Cornwall' subtitle having been dropped) in 43rd (W) Division had the following organisation: 4th Battalion, Dorset Regiment 5th Battalion, Dorset Regiment 7th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment 130th Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company – formed 17 May 1940, disbanded 20 December 1941 Section, No 3 Company, 43rd (Wessex) Divisional Signals, Royal Corps of Signals (RCS) Home Defence In May 1940 43rd (W) Division was preparing to go overseas to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France, but the German invasion of the Low Countries on 10 May ended the 'Phoney War' before the division was ready. When the Battle of France was lost and the BEF was being evacuated from Dunkirk, 43rd (W) Division was one of the few reasonably well-equipped formations left in Home Forces to counter a German invasion of the United Kingdom. It formed part of the mobile GHQ Reserve disposed on the line from Northampton through North London to Aldershot, from which brigade groups could be despatched to any threatened area. During the period when invasion was most feared, the division was stationed just north of London. By the end of 1940 the division was stationed in East Kent, where it remained for the next four years, first in defensive mode, later training intensively for the Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). It was later noted that its habitual training area round Stone Street, outside Folkestone, bore a marked resemblance to the Bocage countryside in Normandy where it would later fight. Normandy 130th Brigade landed in Normandy on 24 June 1944, and for the rest of the North West Europe campaign its normal organisation for mobile operations was as follows: 130 Infantry Brigade Group Brigade HQ Three infantry battalions One machine gun company and one heavy mortar platoon from 8th Bn Middlesex Regiment 112th (Wessex) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery 233rd A/T Battery, 59th (Duke of Connaught's Hampshire) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery One self-propelled (SP) troop from 361 LAA Battery, 110th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery 553rd Field Company, Royal Engineers Section, No 3 Company, 43rd (Wessex) Divisional Signals 130th Field Ambulance, Royal Army Medical Corps 505th Company, Royal Army Service Corps – in the divisional administrative area 130th Infantry Brigade Workshop, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers – in the divisional administrative area Units from the supporting armoured brigade (31 Tank Brigade at Hill 112, usually 8 Armoured Brigade thereafter) would also be attached for specific operations. Hill 112 130 Brigade was in reserve for the division's first action, Operation Epsom on 26 June, but it was assigned a leading role on 10 July in Operation Jupiter, to take Hill 112. As the divisional historian remarked, the brigade's introduction to battle was 'both bloody and abrupt'. The attack was supported by all the divisional artillery and mortars, plus the artillery of 15th (Scottish) Division and 11th Armoured Division and two Army Groups Royal Artillery (AGRAs). 130 Brigade was to advance through Château de Fontaine to capture Éterville and Maltot and the high ground to the south-east of Hill 112. It was accompanied by Churchill tanks from 9th Royal Tank Regiment (9th RTR), M10 Achilles tank destroyers from 86th (5th Devon) A/T Regiment and Churchill Crocodile flamethrowing tanks from 79th Armoured Division. The advance began at 05.00 and at first the brigade's attack went well, 5th Dorsets and C Squadron, 9th RTR, making good progress against the farms on the lower ground and taking the ruins of Château de Fontaine by 06.15. Brigadier Leslie then launched 4th Dorsets into Éterville. Casualties at first were light and the battalion began to consolidate the position, but a 'grim struggle for the far side of the village then developed'. Meanwhile, 7th Hampshires began the attack on Maltot. They got into the village, but many of the supporting tanks and M10s had been knocked out by crossfire from the uncaptured Hill 112 and from beyond Éterville. The leading Hampshires penetrated the village, leaving strongpoints to be mopped up later by the following Dorsets, but they were driven out by counter-attacks. 4th Dorsets, making their second attack of the day, suffered heavy casualties advancing to reach the isolated Hampshires without artillery support. A troop of towed anti-tank guns of 86th A/T Regiment was brought up to place an anti-tank screen round the south of the village while 4th Dorsets fought to suppress the strongpoints inside the village. The anti-tank troop was overrun by a German counter-attack, and after firing all their small arms ammunition the crews had to remove the breechblocks from their guns and retreat to the infantry's slit trenches. The situation in Maltot became untenable, and the surviving troops were withdrawn. 5th Dorsets and 7th Somerset Light Infantry (SLI) from 214 Brigade had a tough fight until the following morning to maintain the positions round Éterville. The division then had to hold its positions under mortar fire for another 14 days, described by the divisional history as comparable only 'to the bombardment at Passchendaele'. Only on 22 July did a final set-piece attack by 129 Brigade (Operation Express) finally succeed in capturing Maltot. Mont Pinçon After a short rest 43rd (Wessex) Division moved west to launch an attack towards the dominating height of Mont Pinçon as part of Operation Bluecoat. Starting at 08.00 on 30 July, the division was to force its way through enemy positions at Briquessard and advance through Cahagnes towards Ondefontaine. 130 Brigade led, reinforced by 4th SLI and Sherman tanks of the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry, followed by the other brigades. Initial casualties were heavy, particularly from mines, and 5th Dorsets attacking on the right soon ran into trouble. On the left 4th Dorsets opened the way for 7th Hampshires to advance on Cahagnes, but it took the accompanying tanks several hours to negotiate the difficult country. The advance achieved only on the first day. and it took until the following morning to clear the mines and restart the advance with 214 Brigade. The division fought its way forward during the next few days to the foot of Mont Pinçon. 130 Brigade got into Ondefontaine on 3 August, and next day pushed through the woods beyond. A new attack was planned for 6 August, with 130 Brigade making a feint to the north, while 129 Brigade continued from the west. During the day 130 Bde made substantial progress, diverting German defenders from the main thrust. It continued next day, while the dominating position of Mont Pinçon fell to a surprise attack, by 129 Bde and its supporting tanks. Having taken Mont Pinçon, 43rd (W) Division participated in the pursuit of the broken enemy, who were soon caught in the Falaise pocket. However, the divisional commander, Maj-Gen Ivor Thomas, considered that Brig Leslie was dilatory in attacking on 13 August and sacked him. He was temporarily replaced by the senior battalion commander, Lt-Col Basil Coad ('Daddy Coad') from 5th Dorsets, until Brig. B.B. Walton arrived three days later. Vernon Bridge After the breakout from the Normandy beachhead, 43rd (W) Division was sent ahead to make an assault crossing of the River Seine at Vernon. US troops had already reached the west bank of the Seine, so the convoys of assault troops and bridging material moving eastwards had to be carefully coordinated to cross with US convoys repositioning to the south. 130 Brigade was in Group 3, a convoy of just over 1000 vehicles including 15th (Kent) GHQ Troops Royal Engineers who were to operate tank rafts and build a heavy Bailey Bridge. The leading group arrived at Vernon on the afternoon of 25 August and began the assault that evening. By 10.00 on 27 August a bridgehead had been secured, the first light bridge (named 'David') was ready, tanks were being ferried across and 130 Bde was assembling in Vernon to be passed across the river when required. The troops in the bridgehead drove off a determined counter-attack, the light bridge (damaged by shellfire) was repaired, and the first 40-ton Bailey ('Goliath') was completed by 19.30. Some of the brigade's troops had already crossed on 'David'; now the rest of the brigade streamed across 'Goliath' and next morning began the breakout. 4th Dorsets cleared the high ground of Germans who had troubled the bridgehead, then 5th Dorsets passed through to capture the villages beyond. 7th Hampshire fought the remains of the defending German battlegroup and captured Tilly. That afternoon, XXX Corps passed through and resumed the pursuit. After the Seine crossing, 43rd (W) Division was 'grounded' while the rest of XXX Corps raced across northern France and Belgium. Market Garden By the time 43rd (W) Division next moved, the war was already away. The first element of 130 Bde to move up was 7th Hampshires, sent on 8 September to reinforce the garrison of liberated Brussels. The whole of the brigade was near Brussels by 11 September, and then 43rd (W) Division concentrated at Diest to take part in Operation Market Garden, beginning on 17 September. In 'Garden', the ground part of the operation, XXX Corps was to link river crossings up to the Nederrijn at Arnhem via a 'carpet' of airborne troops. 43rd (W) Division accompanied by 8 Armoured Bde was to follow Guards Armoured Division, carrying out assault crossings if any of the bridges were found to be destroyed, and protecting the 'corridor' to Arnhem. The division waited as the advance got under way, then on 20 September 130 Bde received orders to move up. The advance up the only road ('Club Route') was painfully slow for the infantry, who were being carried in amphibious DUKWs ready for river crossings, and night found the head of the brigade group still at the great bridge at Grave. Next morning 4th Dorsets took over responsibility for the bridges at Grave and Neerbosch while the rest of 130 Bde caught up with the Guards at Nijmegen. There were no Germans left in Nijmegen and by early afternoon 5th Dorsets had established a tight bridgehead on the north bank of the Waal, while 7th Hampshires guarded the south bank. 214 Brigade passed through at dawn next day and followed the Guards who were held up by fierce resistance on 'The Island' between the Waal and the Nederrijn. 130 Brigade was then relieved at Nijmegen and followed up in DUKWs. At Valburg on 23 September its leading battalion, 5th Dorsets, was cut in half by a German tank attack supported by artillery. While the head of the battalion carried on to link up with the Polish Parachute Brigade at Driel, the rest of the brigade had to fight hard to clear Valburg crossroads. When they got through, 4th Dorsets delivered assault boats to the Poles, a few of whom managed to get across the river. On 24 September the decision was made to evacuate the survivors of 1st Airborne Division. That night, under an intense barrage, 4th Dorsets and the Polish crossed the river to establish a new bridgehead from which to carry out the evacuation. The Dorsets' crossing was a disaster; the assault boats were late arriving, the opposite bank was strongly defended and the two leading companies were scattered and destroyed. The rest of the battalion was pinned down, and the DUKWs carrying stores could not mount the river banks. The following night the final evacuation of the airborne bridgehead was carried out by the Royal Engineers, covered by 130 Bde; around 2300 survivors of 1st Airborne and the Poles were ferried back to the south bank; few of 4th Dorsets made it back. In the aftermath of Market Garden, 43rd (W) Division was stationed on The Island, with 130 Bde still in its exposed positions along the Nederrijn, subject to mortar, machine gun and shell fire. On the night of 26/27 September German troops infiltrated the outposts of 43rd (Wessex) Reconnaissance Regiment to the left (west) and a sharp fight broke out. Brig Walton ordered 7th Hampshires to intervene and recapture Randwijk. Heavy losses were sustained among the houses as the battle escalated, but by midday the ad hoc group of units from 43rd (W) Division had eliminated the German bridgehead. The Germans launched more a serious counter-attack from the east on 1 October, with 116th Panzer Division attacking 130 Bde. 5th Dorsets beat off this attack, but a German party infiltrated into some factory buildings and fortified themselves in brick kilns. 7th Hampshires had to dislodge these troops with the help of RAF Typhoons. On 5 October 43rd (W) handed most of its positions over to the US 101st Airborne Division, but 5th Dorsets had difficulty extricating themselves from their exposed positions round Driel. The battalion left its anti-tank and mortar platoons to help the Americans and fighting continued for another day before the offensive ended. 130 Brigade then relieved the US 82nd Airborne Division on the Groesbeek heights that it had captured during Market Garden. As 43rd (W) Division settled down to hold this static line during the autumn, it rotated its brigades every seven days. Basil Coad was promoted to brigadier and took permanent command of 130 Bde on 7 October. Dorset Wood In November 43rd (W) Division was shifted east for Operation Clipper to capture the Geilenkirchen salient. 130 Brigade's task was to capture Bauchem on the afternoon of 18 November. The village was first subjected to a massive bombardment to protect the flank of 214 Bde attacking Gilrath and Neiderheide, then 130 Bde was due to pass through Gilrath at 15.30 to begin its own attack. The leading battalion, 5th Dorsets, found the village so congested that its supporting tanks from 13th/18th Hussars could not get through. The CO found a route round the village and the attack went in promptly. The battalion took the village and 182 prisoners for just four casualties. However, progress elsewhere was slow on the second day and 130 Bde's attack was cancelled. Instead, 5th Dorsets with the 13th/18th Hussars tanks were tasked with clearing the woods between Tripsrath and Hatterath to secure 214 Bde's position. The battalion advanced under cover of smoke, but once in the woods it was pinned down at a clearing until nightfall when it completed its objectives. The fighting in the woods next day was vicious: once 5th Dorsets reached the edge of the woods they could see the open country behind, but were forced to dig in under heavy fire. Next day the battalion was relieved by 4th Dorsets, who continued the grim defence of what became known as 'Dorset Wood'. Once Geilenkirchen had been captured, 43rd (W) Division then had to defend the ground in conditions resembling the worst of the Western Front in the First World War. The division was moved to the Maas as a reserve during the German Ardennes Offensive but was not engaged. Roer Triangle 43rd (Wessex) Division returned to the offensive in early 1945 in Operation Blackcock to reduce the Roer Triangle. The operation was launched on 16 January and 43rd (W) Division came up on the right of 52nd (Lowland) Division on 20 January. 130 Brigade launched 4th Dorsets at Schier Waldenrath at dawn the next day behind an impressive barrage and carried by Kangaroo Armoured personnel carriers (APCs) of 1st Canadian APC Regiment. Opposition was light, the main problems coming from booby-traps and mines. 5th Dorsets then marched up to relieve 4th SLI at Langbroich while the Kangaroos returned to bring up 7th Hampshires for next day's attack on Waldenrath. The attack by 7th Hampshires on 22 January was a major success: supported by a massive barrage and by Crocodile flamethrowers, the APC-borne infantry swept through Putt and fought their way into Waldenrath, taking 200 prisoners at a cost of 30 casualties. The rest of 43rd (W) Division then continued the advance, though exploitation was prevented by bad weather. 130 Brigade pushed on again on 25 January, but was stopped by ice and mines. The brigade then established defensive positions hidden on reverse slopes and came under the temporary command of 52nd (L) Division from 28 January to 2 February. Reichswald XXX Corps was next tasked with clearing the Reichswald up to the Rhine as part of Operation Veritable. Five divisions made the initial assault on 8 February, with 43rd (W) Division due to pass through on the second day to capture Goch. Although 15th (S) Division achieved all its objectives on 8 February, the roads collapsed into mud and progress was held up on the second day. By the time 43rd (W) was launched, only one congested road was open through the heavily bombed town of Kleve, and the whole division was strung out, with 130 Bde still in Nijmegen. It was left as a reserve for 53rd (Welsh) Division, and it was not until 15 February that it got through to join in the fighting. At first light 4th Dorsets in the lead passed through the exhausted 129 Bde and found itself in a fierce fight with fresh German troops. It pushed on slowly until 7th Hampshires took over the lead in the afternoon, followed in turn by 5th Dorsets. 5th Dorsets arrived just as a night counter-attack came in against 7th Hampshires, but put in a fresh attack with tanks at 09.30 next morning, just in time to clear the start line for 214 Bde's follow-up attack. On 17 February 130 Bde cleared Forst Kleve, but there was little opposition after the wood had been blasted by RAF Typhoons and Canadian rocket projectors (the Land mattress). 43rd (W) Division had now 'rolled up' of the Siegfried Line defences and cleared the escarpment overlooking Goch. On 20 February 130 Bde was pulled out and sent to relieve a Canadian brigade holding a 'watery wilderness' north of Kleve, where the troops had to be taken in aboard Buffalo amphibious vehicles and contact patrols between the isolated companies had to be carried out by boat. The brigade remained here until 11 March, while the rest of the division completed the advance to Xanten on the Rhine. Contact with the enemy was close, but 130 Bde had no artillery support other than Bofors guns of 110th LAA Regiment firing in a ground role. Across the Rhine 43rd (Wessex) Division was given a follow-up task in the assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder). 130 Brigade crossed the river in Buffaloes on 25 March behind 51st (Highland) Division, which had carried out the assault on the night of 23/24 March. 5th Dorsets found themselves in immediate combat without time to reconnoitre, but captured Androp with a night attack, allowing the rest of the brigade to clear Millingen next day. The remainder of the division crossed the bridges that had been erected and advanced to the Ijssel. 130 Brigade then retook the lead on 28 March, with 4th Dorsets capturing Landford on the west bank of the Ijssel before nightfall while 7th Hampshire protected the flank. 5th Dorsets then carried out an opposed landing by assault boats in the dark and its pioneer platoon built a light bridge to allow the battalion anti-tank guns to cross. By 08.30 on 29 March the divisional Royal Engineers had completed a Class 40 Bailey Bridge and the pursuit across Germany could begin. During the subsequent pursuit, 43rd (Wessex) Division was given the task of opening 'Club Route' for XXX Corps. The division was divided into five battle groups for the first drive, incorporating units of 8 Armoured Brigade. 130 Brigade constituted the fourth group. The leading group reached the Twente Canal on 2 April, finding the bridges destroyed. 130 Brigade was therefore brought up to make a crossing at Hengelo, with the tanks of the Sherwood Rangers and 12th Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) attached from 8 Armoured Bde. Rather than a frontal assault, the brigade was sent round to attack from Enschede. The divisional history records that the flank march by cross-country tracks in pouring rain and pitch darkness was a 'remarkable achievement'. At 09.00 next morning 5th Dorsets were launched straight down the road into Hengelo, sweeping aside the resistance while 7th Hampshires enveloped the town from the north. With the canal defences turned, and a bridging site captured, there was no need for an artillery bombardment: the grateful townsfolk later named some of their streets 'Dorset', 'Hampshire' and 'Wessex'. The pursuit continued through April, 130 Bde with the Sherwood Rangers and 12th KRRC taking the direct road, 'Heart Route' and reaching Löningen on 11 April. Here a deliberate attack had to be made by 4th Dorsets against a company of German officer cadets. Then 7th Hampshires pushed ahead on foot, filling cratered roads as they went. Next day 5th Dorsets and the Sherwood Rangers advanced against rearguards. With several British divisions converging on Bremen 43rd (W) was squeezed out, but 130 Bde continued under the command of 52nd (L) Division, which was now in the lead. Bremen having ignored a summons to surrender, XXX Corps pushed on into the outskirts, 130 Bde reverting to 43rd (W) Division's command to advance through spasmodic resistance to cut the Hamburg–Bremen Autobahn. Bremen was secured by 28 April and next day XXX Corps continued its drive into the Cuxhaven peninsula. 130 Brigade led 43rd (W) Division, following immediately behind the Reconnaissance Regiment. 5th Dorsets ran into heavy shellfire from the rearguard of 15th Panzergrenadier Division and fighting went on all night. Further progress was hampered. by cratered roads and blown bridges. 130 Brigade had secured a bridgehead over the Hamme Canal on 4 May and the rest of the division was preparing to move on Bremerhaven next day when news arrived of the German surrender at Lüneburg Heath. After a period as occupation forces in XXX Corps' district, with 130 Bde coming under the temporary command of 51st (H) Division (6–18 May), 43rd (Wessex) Division's HQ and TA units were demobilised at the war's end. Commanders The following officers commanded 130th Infantry Brigade during the Second World War: Brig. H.S.Woodhouse Brig. B.K.Young Brig. F.Y.C.Knox Brig. N.D.Leslie Brig. B.B.Walton Brig. B.A.Coad Postwar When the TA was reformed on 1 January 1947, 130 (West Country) Infantry Brigade was reformed in 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division with the following composition: 4th Bn Devons at Exeter 5th Bn Devons at Plymouth 4th/5th Bn DCLI at Truro 4th Bn Dorsets at Dorchester 130 Brigade Signals, RCS, at Torquay – became 342 Signal Squadron in 1959 On 15 May 1950 all three TA battalions of the Devons merged to form a single 4th Bn, reducing 130 Bde to the normal three-battalion establishment. In 1961 the division was reduced to a district headquarters as 43rd Division/District, and it was disbanded on the reduction of the TA into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967.

Distribution It is known from tropical climates from northern Brazil north through Central America, the West Indies and Mexico to southern Arizona. Description The wingspan is 70–102 mm. The upperside of the female forewing is mostly gray brown on the front half and dark brown on the rear half while the upperside of male forewing is yellow gray or gray brown. Both sexes have wavy dark markings. The upperside of the hindwing of both sexes is yellow with an incomplete dark border on the outer margin. Biology There are multiple generations per year in the tropics. In Arizona, adults have been recorded in August. They feed on flower nectar, including petunias. The larvae have been recorded feeding on Plumeria rubra in Cuba and Plumeria alba, Plumeria obtusa and Plumeria rubra in Puerto Rico.

{"text": "Torrens Island Power Station is located on Torrens Island, near Adelaide, South Australia and is operated by AGL Energy. It burns natural gas in eight steam turbines to generate up to 1,280 MW of electricity. The gas is supplied via the SEAGas pipeline from Victoria, and the Moomba Adelaide Pipeline System (MAPS) from Moomba in the Cooper Basin. The station is capable of burning either natural gas or fuel oil. It is the largest power station in South Australia and was formerly the largest single power station user of natural gas in Australia. Construction Construction began in 1963 following passing of a government act vesting the land and authorising construction. The 480 MW (4 x 120MW) A Station was completed in 1967, and construction of the 800 MW (4 x 200MW) B Station was completed in 1982. Gradual shutdown In December 2014 AGL announced that it intended mothballing the four older units of the A Station indefinitely, having taken them out of service between July and September 2014. This decision was primarily driven by increasing levels of wind and solar generation in the South Australian region of the National Electricity Market displacing fossil fuel generation, particularly higher cost gas-fired generation. AGL reviewed this decision and deferred the planned mothballing in June 2016, following the closure of Alinta's Northern and Playford B coal-fired power stations at Port Augusta However, due to the state-wide power outage in September 2016, the system operator AEMO demanded that the Torrens Island power station to be brought back online to prevent another statewide power outage. AGL announced on 7 June 2017 that it intended to permanently mothball two of the turbines in the 50-year-old Torrens A power station, after building a new 210MW power station containing twelve gas reciprocating engines to be known as Barker Inlet Power Station adjacent to the Torrens Island site. The first two units (2 and 4) would be mothballed from 1 July 2019, with the remaining two units (1 and 3) planned to be mothballed after winter 2020 and winter 2021. AGL announced a delay in the closure schedule in July 2019, with Units 2 and 4 rescheduled to close in September 2020, and Units 1 and 3 to close in September 2021 and September 2022. On 7 July 2021, AGL announced plans to also mothball unit B1 in October 2021. It will be able to be recalled on 6 months lead time. At the same time, AGL announced construction of a 250MW grid battery on the Torrens Island site. On 24 November 2022, AGL announced that it would bring forward full closure, and Torrens Island B would be retired on 30 June 2026.

His interest in the arts was evident by an early correspondence with the artist Franz Pforr (1788–1812). He moved to Paris in 1809 to further his business interests. He returned to Frankfurt in 1824 where art history evermore occupied his interest. His Tour of a German artist in England (1833 in German; 1836 translated into English by Lady Eastlake) remains a significant source for art historians, as do his catalogues of old master prints, whose numbering is still followed by some collections. In the year 1839 he became Inspektor (curator) of the Städelsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt. There he acquired important works in the prints and drawing area, mounted exhibitions, and taught. Passavant developed the three principal genres of art writing important for the next two centuries: the scholarly artistic biography, the aesthetic travelogue, and the reference survey. As a historian, he followed the romantic tradition. His paintings include Holy Family with Elizabeth and John 1819, Staadtische Galerie im Staadelschen Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt and A Visitation, Christ and the Samaritan c. 1820, Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin.

{"text": "Luigi Apolloni (; born 2 May 1967) is an Italian football manager and former player, who played as a centre-back. At club level, Apolloni is mainly remembered for his time with Italian side Parma Calcio 1913, where he won several titles during his 13 seasons with the club. At international level, he was a member of the Italy national football team that reached the final of the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Club career Born in Frascati, Apolloni started his career with Lodigiani in 1983–84 in Serie C2, without ever get off the field in the first team to advance to Pistoiese within two years, where he debuted in professional football. After another year in Serie C1 to Reggiana, he joined Parma in 1987, became a key member of the squad and a mainstay in the team's defensive lineup alongside Lorenzo Minotti; the two players formed a notable central defensive partnership at the club, helping to guide the team from the Serie B to Serie A, and eventually, to the top levels of European football. Their time at the club included triumphs in the 1991–92 Coppa Italia, a Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Super Cup in 1993, a runners-up medal in their 1993–94 European Cup Winners' Cup campaign, and two UEFA Cups in 1995 and 1999, as well as the Supercoppa Italiana and another Coppa Italia in 1999, a runners-up medal in the 1995 Supercoppa Italiana, and third and second-place finishes in Serie A in 1995 and 1997 respectively. In 1996 a serious injury forced him out, and Apolloni did not manage to win back a place in the starting lineup, ultimately leaving Parma in 1999 to join Hellas Verona, and later ending his career in 2001 with a total of 255 appearances and 7 goals in the Italian top flight. International career Following his successes with Parma, Apolloni gained a spot in the Italian squad under head coach Arrigo Sacchi, making his international debut on 27 May 1994, in a 2–0 home win against Finland, coincidentally in Parma. Overall, he made 15 appearances for Italy between 1994 and 1996, and was a member of the azzurri squad that took part at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, where they reached the final, in which he appeared, only to lose to Brazil on penalties. He was also a part of their less successful Euro 1996 campaign, appearing in Italy's opening two group matches, a 2–1 win over a Russia, and a 2–1 defeat to eventual runners-up the Czech Republic, in which he was sent off; the Italians were eliminated in the first round of the tournament. Managerial career In 2006 Apolloni accepted to follow former Parma teammate Daniele Zoratto, serving as his aide at Modena. He was later sacked together with head coach Zoratto in February 2007, only to return at Modena in April 2008. In January 2009, Apolloni was appointed as caretaker manager of the canarini after Zoratto left the club by mutual consent. He was then permanently appointed to the role after he managed to guide Modena to escape relegation at the final day of the season. In his first full season in charge of the club, Apolloni guided Modena to a mid-table place in the league despite severe financial issues within the club. In July 2010 he left Modena to join ambitious Serie B club Grosseto. He was however removed by the end of September due to poor results, and replaced by Francesco Moriero. On 2 April 2012, he was appointed as new head coach of Gubbio in the Italian Serie B league until the end of the season, thus becoming the fourth manager of the season for the small relegation-threatened Umbrian club (after Fabio Pecchia, Luigi Simoni and Marco Alessandrini). On 31 May 2018, Apolloni was appointed as the manager of Modena. It lasted until 10 January 2019, where he was fired.

{"text": "In numerical analysis and computational fluid dynamics, Godunov's theorem — also known as Godunov's order barrier theorem — is a mathematical theorem important in the development of the theory of high-resolution schemes for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. The theorem states that: Linear numerical schemes for solving partial differential equations (PDE's), having the property of not generating new extrema (monotone scheme), can be at most first-order accurate. Professor Sergei Godunov originally proved the theorem as a Ph.D. student at Moscow State University. It is his most influential work in the area of applied and numerical mathematics and has had a major impact on science and engineering, particularly in the development of methods used in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and other computational fields. One of his major contributions was to prove the theorem (Godunov, 1954; Godunov, 1959), that bears his name. The theorem We generally follow Wesseling (2001). Aside Assume a continuum problem described by a PDE is to be computed using a numerical scheme based upon a uniform computational grid and a one-step, constant step-size, M grid point, integration algorithm, either implicit or explicit. Then if and , such a scheme can be described by In other words, the solution at time and location is a linear function of the solution at the previous time step . We assume that determines uniquely. Now, since the above equation represents a linear relationship between and we can perform a linear transformation to obtain the following equivalent form, Theorem 1: Monotonicity preserving The above scheme of equation (2) is monotonicity preserving if and only if Proof - Godunov (1959) Case 1: (sufficient condition) Assume (3) applies and that is monotonically increasing with . Then, because it therefore follows that because This means that monotonicity is preserved for this case. Case 2: (necessary condition) We prove the necessary condition by contradiction. Assume that for some and choose the following monotonically increasing , Then from equation (2) we get Now choose , to give which implies that is NOT increasing, and we have a contradiction. Thus, monotonicity is NOT preserved for , which completes the proof. Theorem 2: Godunov’s Order Barrier Theorem Linear one-step second-order accurate numerical schemes for the convection equation cannot be monotonicity preserving unless where is the signed Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition (CFL) number. Proof - Godunov (1959) Assume a numerical scheme of the form described by equation (2) and choose The exact solution is If we assume the scheme to be at least second-order accurate, it should produce the following solution exactly Substituting into equation (2) gives: Suppose that the scheme IS monotonicity preserving, then according to the theorem 1 above, . Now, it is clear from equation (15) that Assume and choose such that . This implies that and . It therefore follows that, which contradicts equation (16) and completes the proof. The exceptional situation whereby is only of theoretical interest, since this cannot be realised with variable coefficients. Also, integer CFL numbers greater than unity would not be feasible for practical problems. See also Finite volume method Flux limiter Total variation diminishing References Godunov, Sergei K.

{"text": "Antonio Benarrivo (; born 21 August 1968) is an Italian former professional footballer who played as a defender. One of the best players in the world in his position in the 1990s, Benarrivo was an energetic attacking full-back capable of operating on both wings; he began his career with Brindisi in 1986, and later moved to Padova in 1989. He came to prominence during his time with Parma, joining the club in 1991; he won several domestic and European titles with the team and eventually became the club's record appearance holder in Serie A and in European competitions. At international level, Benarrivo represented Italy at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, where they reached the final. Club career Benarrivo started playing with the professional football team of his city, Brindisi, in Serie C1, during the 1986–87 season. After three seasons playing in Apulia, he went to play for Padova in Serie B, where he remained for two years, attracting much attention from larger Italian clubs. In 1991, Benarrivo was bought by Parma under Nevio Scala; that year, he would help his new team to qualify for the UEFA Cup in his first year in Serie A. He quickly became one of the strongest players of the Emilian side, which achieved notable domestic and European successes over the next decade. In his first year in the highest division, Bennarivo won the 1992 Italian Cup, and the following year, during the 1992–93 season, he won the 1993 Cup Winners' Cup. He reached a second consecutive Cup Winners' Cup final during the 1993–94 season and was defeated, although he was able to capture the European Supercup with the club in 1993. The series of thrilling triumphs he endured during his time at Parma, which culminated in the UEFA Cup victory during the 1994–95 season, as well as another Coppa Italia final, were not quite replicated in Serie A, however. Although Parma managed to navigate the top spots of the table during these seasons, they were not able to beat the dominant Milan and Juventus sides to the Serie A title, with their best finish coming during the 1996–97 season, where they finished the league in second place, qualifying for the 1997–98 UEFA Champions League; they also managed a third-place finish during the 1994–95 season, as well as several fourth-place finishes during this time, usually achieving European qualification. Benarrivo experienced another successful year with the club during the 1998–99 season. Parma finished fourth place in the league, but Benarrivo finished the season with the conquest of his second UEFA Cup and Italian Cup titles, following these successes up with the 1999 Supercoppa Italiana, a title which had evaded him in 1995. This would be his final season as an indisputable starter, however, and the following seasons would see him play with less regularity. During the 1999–2000 season, Parma finished in fourth place yet again, and narrowly missed out on qualifying for the UEFA Champions League after losing out to Inter in the playoff match. Parma managed their third consecutive fourth-place finish in the league during the 2000–01 season, also reaching another Coppa Italia final, only to be defeated by Fiorentina. Benarrivo managed to add another trophy to his club silverware, however, with a third Italian Cup in 2002. Benarrivo retired from professional football in 2004. With the Emilian club, he collected 257 appearances in Serie A, scoring 5 goals, and is the club's record appearance holder in the top-tier of Italian football. Following his retirement, he worked as a coach. International career Benarrivo played with the national team a total of 23 times, and for a period, he was the starting right-back for the Italians. He made his debut on 22 September 1993 under manager Arrigo Sacchi, in a 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Estonia. He took part in the 1994 FIFA World Cup with Italy, where they reached the final only to lose out to Brazil on penalties. Benarrivo was a key member of the starting line-up for the 1994 World Cup, also featuring in the final defeat, and demonstrating his tactical versatility as he alternated between playing on the right and the left flanks. During the tournament, he notably won a penalty in extra time during the round of 16 match against Nigeria, from which Roberto Baggio subsequently scored, sending the Italians to the quarter-finals. Benarrivo played with the national side until 1997, making his final appearance on 29 October, against Russia. Playing style Although he was usually deployed on the right, Benarrivo was comfortable playing on both flanks. An energetic offensive full-back, he was known for his attacking prowess, despite rarely scoring, and was sometimes employed as a wing-back, or as a makeshift wide midfielder, due to his pace, stamina, offensive capabilities, technique, crossing accuracy and ability to cover the flank both offensively and defensively. These attributes led him to be considered one of the best players in his position during the 1990s.

{"text": "Westend is a district of the city of Espoo, Finland. It is located next to Tapiola and about ten kilometers from the center of Helsinki. From Westend you can get to Helsinki along Länsiväylä (National road 51). Known as an affluent area, Westend is the wealthiest postal code area of Finland by mean household income. In 2019, the area was home to more than 3,000 residents. Westend is a part of the \"Greater Tapiola\" district, which also comprises Haukilahti, Laajalahti, Mankkaa, Niittykumpu, Otaniemi, Pohjois-Tapiola and Tapiola. There are other wealthy neighborhoods with the same name in the UK and the US. The most well known example being West End of London. Contrary to the district's name, Westend is located in the very southeastern corner of Espoo, west from the Helsinki city centre, by the shore of the Gulf of Finland. Westend also comprises some islands on the coast. Sights The Rantaraitti hiking trail passes through Westend, and most of Westend's beaches are located along the trail. There are also some well preserved parts of the World War I era land and sea fortress Krepost Sveaborg in Westend. History The goal of the planning of Westend was to create a high-quality marine villa town in southern Espoo. Particular attention was paid to environmental planning and comfort. Before southern Espoo was heavily developed in the latter part of the 20th century, the village of Hirböle occupied the area, at least since the 17th century. The village of Hirböle received a Finnish name Hiirala later on, and the names survive in some street names (Hiiralantie, Hirbölevägen). There are also old trenches in the area near the border between Westend and Haukilahti, built during the First World War for defending Helsinki from a possible German invasion. The Westend area was owned and planned by the lord of the Hagalund manor, Licentiate of Medicine and tennis champion Arne Grahn, and a park avenue has been named after him. The planning was done by Ragnar Gustafsson in 1934. The street map of Westend still remains mostly identical to Gustafsson's 1930s plan. New construction in Westend has occurred mostly by dismantling old buildings, so the old street map plan has been preserved. Development of Westend is closely connected to the Tapiola garden city built to the north of Westend. In 1945 Grahn commissioned Otto-Iivari Meurman to design a similar plan for a \"city\" of about 12 thousand inhabitants to be built on the Hagalund lands, and in the early 1950s he sold the area to the Väestöliitto federation, which bought it for the new Asuntosäätiö foundation. The structure of Westend was based on Meurman's ideal of an English garden city, whereas the development of Tapiola was done by the leader of Asuntosäätiö Heikki von Hertzen and younger architects (Aarne Ervi, Viljo Revell, Markus Tavio), targeting a new urban vision. The Westend area was built starting from the 1930s. Grahn commissioned the Westend tennis hall with two indoor tennis courts and eight outdoor courts. The fencing events of the 1952 Olympic Games were hosted in the Westend tennis hall. In 1949 Grahn sold the hall to the Central Association of Agricultural Producers, and the hall served as a school building. After the Olympics, the Central Association received a new education centre and the tennis hall returned to its original use. In the late 1960s the tennis hall served as a primary school. The hall was destroyed in a fire in 1967. In the 1970s the Westend area attracted wealthy people and Westend became one of the most expensive places in the entire country of Finland to live in. Most of the new apartments in Westend were built from the 1970s to the 1990s. The apartments in the area are divided fairly evenly between different building types, the most common type being small detached houses. Architecture The architecture in Westend ranges from Art Nouveau mansions to the modern architecture of the last few years. In the early years the buildings were designed by designers newly arrived in Westend such as Georg Wigström, as well as architects on commissions. Functionalist buildings include Liinasaarentie by Olavi Numminen in 1938 as well as Villa v. Heiroth by Matti Finell in 1936 at Mansikkatie 2 and Länsilinnake 12 designed by Aulis Kalma for sculptor Gunnar Elfgren in 1939. 1940s-style buildings include Ollonqvist (Westendintie 71) by Viljo Revell in 1945, Dag Englund's 1947 villa plan (Westendintie 53) and Villa H. Schlüter (Westendintie 55) by Matti Finell in 1950. The construction of these buildings make use of slate rock and details typical of the time. Other prominent houses include the culmination of classic tradition Villa Blumberg (Ankkurisaarentie 6, 1948), the multi-faceted Villa Kihlström (Hiiralantie 5) by P. Lauste in the late 1940s as well as director Kaarlo Forsman's house at Lyökkiniemi 5, designed by Forsman himself. Since the 1950s architecture in Westend has developed into more diverse options. Modernist buildings include the prominently straight-lined Grönhagen house designed by architect Eero Eerikäinen at Hiiralankaari 3 in 1954. The Villa Ulfves building (Kuninkaanniemi 2) designed by Kristian Gullichsen was built in the early 1960s, representing a type of bungalow with spaces wrapping around an inner atrium. The series of buildings in Westend designed by Erkki Kairamo since the early 1970s represented new and creative, yet tradition-conscious architecture, such as the paired houses at Lyökkiniemi 6 (late 1980s), the Japanese-style white cubical paired houses at Liinasaarenkuja and the terraced houses at Liinasaarentie 3, with movable lattices at the terraces. Spa hotel project A new spa hotel with a 18-storey high-rise hotel building is being planned at the area between the Westend beach and the Länsiväylä highway. The planned name for the hotel is Marriott Westend Helsinki. The public beach will remain in its current use. There is an option for a hiking trail between the hotel and the seashore. The plan change for the hotel was made in 2009, after which construction of the hotel was originally supposed to start in 2012 and the hotel was supposed to open for the public in 2014. The spa hotel project has fallen behind schedule, as Heini Wathén, also known as a beauty queen, made a complaint about it to the European Commission in November 2013. According to her, building a congress centre at the planned site would breach the nature directive of the European Union.

After a diplomatic defeat in the Oriental Crisis of 1840 France shifted its focus to the Rhine, and the French government, led by Adolphe Thiers, restated its claim to areas on the left bank, to re-establish the Rhine as a natural border between France and Germany. These claims stoked resentment among the Germans against the French, and increased nationalism on both sides. New nationalist songs were written in France and Germany and achieved huge popularity, most famously the German songs \"Die Wacht am Rhein\", \"Der Deutsche Rhein\" and the \"Lied der Deutschen\" (the national anthem of Germany since 1922). In the end, the crisis passed peacefully, when Thiers resigned as prime minister and a more conciliatory government was installed in France. Background Oriental Crisis of 1840 The Greek War of Independence and the Russo-Turkish War (1828–29) had considerably weakened the Ottoman Empire. In 1831, Muhammad Ali of Egypt (Wali of Ottoman Egypt), technically a vassal of the Ottoman Sultan but in practice exercising considerable independence, demanded control of Greater Syria (constituting much of the Levant) from the Sultan as compensation for his assistance during the Greek war. Egyptian troops moved into Palestine and Syria, reaching Anatolia by 1832 before being stopped by the threat of Great Power intervention to protect the Sultan, though Muhammad Ali kept control of Syria. France had taken the Turkish defeat in the Greek War of Independence as an opportunity to occupy Algeria, previously also nominally an Ottoman vassal, in 1830, and had aligned themselves closely with Muhammad Ali throughout the 1830s, as part of a strategy to expand their Mediterranean influence. In June 1839, Ottoman troops sought to reoccupy the lands they had ceded in 1833, but were badly defeated on June 24, followed shortly by the Sultan Mahmud II's death from tuberculosis on July 1. The Ottoman Navy defected to Muhammad Ali, threatening the collapse of the empire. The United Kingdom, Prussia, and Austria feared that destabilization in the Ottoman Empire would lead to increased influence for Russia over the Dardanelles and Balkans. Russia also viewed the total collapse of the Ottoman Empire as too risky and had followed a policy of increasing its influence by helping prop up the existing regime. Accordingly, these four powers signed the 1840 Convention of London, on July 15, 1840, effectively an ultimatum against Muhammad Ali to withdraw from Syria and submit to the new Sultan Abdulmejid I. France was taken by surprise when the other four powers moved forward without French input on the agreement. French political situation The politics of the July Monarchy in France in the late 1830s were very unstable. The regime of King Louis-Philippe I faced opposition from Legitimists who sought the restoration of the senior Bourbon line to the throne, Bonapartists who sought a restoration of Napoleon's line to the throne, and Republicans who pushed for an end to monarchy in favor of a republic. In elections in March 1839, a coalition of left-wing and nationalists won a clear majority in the Chamber of Deputies. However, disputes among the factions of the left and efforts by the king to reduce the influence of anti-monarchical parties prevented a new cabinet from forming until a failed republican insurrection in May led to a new government led by Marshal Soult, a firm supporter of the Louis-Philippe. However, the Soult-led government fell only nine months later on a relatively minor vote concerning a proposed dowry for the King's second son, Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours. Soult was succeeded as Prime Minister by Adolphe Thiers. Disliked by Louis-Philippe, Thiers was a strong supporter of parliamentarization, he was associated with revolutionary and nationalist causes because of his leading role in the July Revolution and his historical writings on the French Revolution and Napoleonic era. He had recently adopted a strongly nationalist tone in parliamentary debates and made references to national honor and the nationalist enthusiasm of the revolutionary period. A coup attempt by Louis Napoleon in August 1840 failed, but further illustrated the instability of the domestic political situation in France. Belgian-Luxembourg settlement A further factor contributing to the Rhine crisis was the final settlement of the Belgian-Luxembourg question in 1839. When the Belgian Revolution 1830 separated Belgium from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, a member of the German Confederation in a personal union with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, lost over half its territory. This division was cemented in the Treaty of London (1839). Although the lost territory was populated mainly by non-Germans, many German nationalists were upset by the failure of the Confederation to prevent the loss of its territory and were highly attuned to the threat of further territorial losses in the west. Crisis French demands In France, the surprise announcement of the Convention of London signed by the other four Great Powers on July 15 was viewed as a renewal of the grand anti-French coalitions that had been victorious in 1814 and 1815. The exclusion of France was seen as a foreign policy crisis by nationalists and public opinion swung in a nationalistic direction amidst talk of a \"diplomatic Waterloo\". Starting with the liberal newspaper Le Constitutionnel on August 1, 1840, demands for a foray to the Rhine spread along with calls for territorial \"compensation\" for the perceived snub and the defeat of France's ally in Egypt. Similar calls quickly spread to Bonapartist and Legitimist newspapers. As had happened during the July Revolution in 1830, there were loud calls for revision of the 1815 treaties and a revival of the militant nationalism that had dominated the Revolutionary period. Although Thiers and Louis-Philippe knew France was not prepared for war, much less a war against an alliance of the four Great Powers, they also recognized that the popular outrage represented a threat to the government and the monarchy. With the king's support, Thiers resorted to a bluff: he publicly called for the restoration of the Rhine frontier and the reannexation of the Left Bank of the Rhine. In support of this demand, he called up reservists on August 5, 1840, mobilized forces near the border, he issued a government loan for armaments purposed, and began a massive fortification project around Paris. Thiers hoped that Muhammad Ali would be able to hold out in Syria while France pressed for a renegotiated settlement. German reaction On the German side, a similar wave of nationalist excitement arose in response. Particularly in the western states of the German Confederation, Francophobia and war hysteria were rampant in the press. Some demanded the reconquest of Alsace and Lorraine (border regions with large German-speaking populations) from France in response. Elsewhere the response was more muted, particularly further from the border, but the power of the German nationalist idea was seen in the outcry. Just as French nationalists questioned the justice of the 1815 settlements, some Germans questioned the decision to forego significant territorial concessions from France after the Napoleonic wars, with some calls for annexing Switzerland as well as French border fortifications. The crisis resulted in a significant shift among German liberals. Before 1840, Germany liberals were fairly Francophilic and willing to put political freedom above national unity -- many had spent time in exile in France, the French Revolution and July Revolution were often viewed as models to be followed, and French writers and theorists were heavily influential. The Rhine crisis changed the view of France from a continental bastion of liberal parliamentarianism to focus on the militaristic and chauvinistic elements of the revolutionary spirit, turning many German liberals away from France and toward a more nationalist-liberal view, which was highly influential in the German revolutions of 1848–1849. The weaknesses of the German military under the Confederation received significant attention. Relying on the contribution of troops, equipment, and funds from all Confederation states, coordinating the German Federal Army was very difficult and the small states were heavily reliant on the two German Great Powers of Prussia and Austria, each of whom had their own foreign policy goals independent of the Confederation. With the weakness brought into sharp focus by France's sabre-rattling in the west, calls for further integration in the Confederation gained some strength. Some steps were taken to increase military preparedness and strengthen cooperation. The new King of Prussia, Frederick William IV, proposed an expansion of the German Confederation's military and improvements to the fortifications of Mainz, Ulm, and Rastatt, while the Kingdom of Bavaria built the fortress at Germersheim. Prussia and Austria also agreed to a military union in the case of a French attack. However, further moves toward German unity were not pursued by the conservative leaders and the rulers of smalls states continued to defend their independence. Deescalation and resolution The King made it clear to Thiers that he wanted peace, a position backed by many in the Cabinet due to the poor state of military preparedness and the continuing military efforts in Algeria. Thiers offered to resign, but the king refused his resignation, arguing that he wanted the British to believe that France would fight. And indeed, the combined British and Austrian Fleets, after blockading the Nile delta, did not attack Egypt, but moved east to the ports of Syria. In September 1840, joint British, Austrian, and Ottoman forces bombarded and captured several Syrian ports from the Egyptians and Muhammad Ali's military position in the Levant became untenable. In October, the King struck several Thiers-drafted lines he deemed too confrontational from his annual address to the Chamber of Deputies and Thiers tendered his resignation again which was accepted on October 29, 1840. Thiers was succeeded by his predecessor, Marshal Soult, whose government struck a more conciliatory line with the other Great Powers, dropping any demand for territorial concession in Europe and actively seeking to rejoin the Concert of Europe. Despite overwhelming military superiority, the Great Powers declined to depose Muhammad Ali in Egypt and while the settlement revoked his earlier gains in Syria and reduced his army and navy, it reaffirmed his position in Egypt and made it hereditary, though subject to the Ottoman throne. The new cabinet, with Guizot as Secretary of State, sailed a more conciliatory course, and all five Great Powers signed the London Straits Convention (13 July 1841) settled the matter of the Dardanelles, defusing tension in Europe. Consequences and significance Once the threat of a general European war was lifted, the Rhine crisis's immediate impact was fairly limited outside of French internal politics. France dropped its demand for the Left Bank of the Rhine and the aggressive government was replaced with more conservative leadership which brought France back into the Concert of Europe. Within France, apart from bringing down the Thiers government, the episode illustrated popular disappointment with France's failure to live up to the national and military ideals of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic period are sometimes cited as contributing to the downfall of the July Monarchy in 1848 and the return of the Napoleonic dynasty to power. However, the most significant long-term impact of the crisis was the explosion of national sentiment in Germany. Previously the province of intellectuals and other elites, the Rhine crisis saw expressions of German nationalist sentiment across social classes. It also generated significant anti-French sentiment and helped tie together German nationalism with Francophobia and diminished the amity between German and French liberals. The nationalist response to the Crisis also laid the ground for the sharp responses of Prussia to the Schleswig-Holstein Question and the Luxembourg Crisis and the threat that further territory would be lost from the Confederation. The consequences of the Rhine crisis in Germany were described thus by Heinrich Heine: \"Thiers drummed our fatherland into this great movement which awakened political life in Germany; Thiers brought us back on our feet as a nation.\" Poetry and music The conflict gave rise to an explosion of patriotic and nationalist poetry on both sides. On the German side, the Rheinliedbewegung (Rhine-song movement) brought forth thousands of poems with such titles as \"You shall not have it, the free German Rhine\" and \"Die Wacht am Rhein\" (\"The Watch on the Rhine\"). Such poems were published in nearly every newspaper with the most successful reprinted across the country and set to music, some many different times by some of the most successful composers of the day. The French responded with their own poems such as the ironic \"The German Rhine\" (Le rhin allemand) and \"La Teutomanie.\" In 1842 Victor Hugo wrote \"Le Rhin\" a travel book which ends with a call for France to extend its borders to the Rhine.

{"text": "In the mathematical theory of stochastic processes, local time is a stochastic process associated with semimartingale processes such as Brownian motion, that characterizes the amount of time a particle has spent at a given level. Local time appears in various stochastic integration formulas, such as Tanaka's formula, if the integrand is not sufficiently smooth. It is also studied in statistical mechanics in the context of random fields. Formal definition For a continuous real-valued semimartingale , the local time of at the point is the stochastic process which is informally defined by where is the Dirac delta function and is the quadratic variation. It is a notion invented by Paul Lévy. The basic idea is that is an (appropriately rescaled and time-parametrized) measure of how much time has spent at up to time . More rigorously, it may be written as the almost sure limit which may be shown to always exist. Note that in the special case of Brownian motion (or more generally a real-valued diffusion of the form where is a Brownian motion), the term simply reduces to , which explains why it is called the local time of at . For a discrete state-space process , the local time can be expressed more simply as Tanaka's formula Tanaka's formula also provides a definition of local time for an arbitrary continuous semimartingale on A more general form was proven independently by Meyer and Wang; the formula extends Itô's lemma for twice differentiable functions to a more general class of functions. If is absolutely continuous with derivative which is of bounded variation, then where is the left derivative. If is a Brownian motion, then for any the field of local times has a modification which is a.s. Hölder continuous in with exponent , uniformly for bounded and . In general, has a modification that is a.s. continuous in and càdlàg in . Tanaka's formula provides the explicit Doob–Meyer decomposition for the one-dimensional reflecting Brownian motion, . Ray–Knight theorems The field of local times associated to a stochastic process on a space is a well studied topic in the area of random fields. Ray–Knight type theorems relate the field Lt to an associated Gaussian process. In general Ray–Knight type theorems of the first kind consider the field Lt at a hitting time of the underlying process, whilst theorems of the second kind are in terms of a stopping time at which the field of local times first exceeds a given value. First Ray–Knight theorem Let (Bt)t ≥ 0 be a one-dimensional Brownian motion started from B0 = a > 0, and (Wt)t≥0 be a standard two-dimensional Brownian motion started from W0 = 0 ∈ R2. Define the stopping time at which B first hits the origin, . Ray and Knight (independently) showed that where (Lt)t ≥ 0 is the field of local times of (Bt)t ≥ 0, and equality is in distribution on C[0, a]. The process |Wx|2 is known as the squared Bessel process. Second Ray–Knight theorem Let (Bt)t ≥ 0 be a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion B0 = 0 ∈ R, and let (Lt)t ≥ 0 be the associated field of local times. Let Ta be the first time at which the local time at zero exceeds a > 0 Let (Wt)t ≥ 0 be an independent one-dimensional Brownian motion started from W0 = 0, then Equivalently, the process (which is a process in the spatial variable ) is equal in distribution to the square of a 0-dimensional Bessel process started at , and as such is Markovian. Generalized Ray–Knight theorems Results of Ray–Knight type for more general stochastic processes have been intensively studied, and analogue statements of both () and () are known for strongly symmetric Markov processes.

{"text": "The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) has seven subject-based environmental data centres (EDCs) to store and distribute data from its own research programmes and data that are of general use to the environmental research community. These data centres are sometimes called the NERC designated Data Centres. The Data Centres The NERC Environmental Data Centres and their areas of responsibility are as follows: British Oceanographic Data Centre - Marine Science Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA), joint responsibility with Science and Technology Facilities Council which include: British Atmospheric Data Centre - Atmospheric Science NERC Earth Observation Data Centre - Earth Observation UK Solar System Data Centre - Solar terrestrial physics (Earth Orientated) Environmental Information Data Centre - Terrestrial & Freshwater Science, part of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology National Geoscience Data Centre (NGDC) - Earth Sciences - part of British Geological Survey Polar Data Centre (UK PDC) - Polar Science - British Antarctic Survey The data centres hold data from environmental scientists working in the UK and around the world. They provide access to a comprehensive data and information resource about our environment, through the NERC Data Catalog Service. CEDA hosts the NERC Data Catalog Service, data may also be cataloged from certain NERC Data Centres and also at data.gov.uk. Access to these data is freely available to students, researchers and stakeholders, as well as business users and policy makers, to help them understand the environment in which we live. Each data centre works to build user confidence, using common data formats and noting sources, contexts, and degrees of accuracy. They combine expertise in the scientific collection of information, state-of-the-art data management and preservation techniques, making them an important national asset. NERC Data Policy The NERC Data Policy is commitment to support the long-term management of environmental data and also outlines the roles and responsibilities of all those involved in collecting and managing environmental data. The NERC Data Centres provide support and guidance in data management to those funded by NERC, are responsible for the long-term management of data and provide access to NERC's holdings of environmental data. The data policy is consistent with legal frameworks, such as the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, the INSPIRE Regulations 2009 and contractual arrangements with other bodies where, for example, NERC holds data on their behalf but does not own the intellectual property rights. To reflect NERC's continuing commitment to openness and transparency in the research process, and in support of the government's developing agenda on open access to public data, the NERC Data Policy has been substantially revised, and this new version of NERC's Data Policy came into force in January 2011. Charging Policy The NERC charging regime recognises two classes of data: Raw or unrefined - these are data collected (or held) by NERC, with any necessary quality assurance or post processing applied, and used to deliver NERC's public function; Value added or refined - these are data where an extra level of intellectual input has been added, for example, by combining a number of data sets together, or producing an information product by the interpretation of a number of data sets, and crucially, is above and beyond what is required to deliver NERC's public function. The licence charges that NERC can levy for the supply of data and information are governed by HM Treasury guidance and Government regulations. During 2010 NERC aimed to move to a position where it will supply its data for free for all teaching and research activities, apart from large or complex requests where they may make a nominal handling charge. Science Information Strategy The NERC Science Information Strategy (SIS) was created to provide the framework for NERC to work more closely and effectively with its scientific communities, both internal and external, in delivering data and information management services to support its five-year science strategy, the Next Generation Science for Planet Earth 2007-2012. The Science Information Strategy is being implemented in three phases, beginning April 2010. Each of these phases will be made up of a number of smaller projects. Project/Phase 1 will concentrate on determining user requirements, documenting existing holdings, agreeing an information architecture, updating the NERC Data Policy and improving the data discovery tools. The benefits of the SIS implementation for science include the increased competence of data centre staff to inform the science community, policy and decision makers nationally and internationally on best practice, standards development and the establishment of new projects and initiatives (e.g. EU Framework projects):enhancing NERC's national and international reputation and increased capability to conduct multi-disciplinary, integrated science.

{"text": "The 129th Infantry Brigade was an infantry brigade of the British Army that served during both the First and Second World Wars. In both wars the brigade was part of 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division. History Formation The brigade was originally formed in 1908 in the Territorial Force (TF) as the South Western Brigade attached to the Wessex Division. It was composed of four TF infantry battalions, the 4th and 5th of the Prince Albert's (Somerset Light Infantry), the 4th Battalion of the Dorsetshire Regiment, and the 4th Battalion of the Duke of Edinburgh's (Wiltshire Regiment). First World War The division was mobilised in August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. The division was sent overseas to India to free up Regular Army troops for service on the Western Front in France and Belgium. In 1915 the division was numbered as the 43rd (Wessex) Division and the brigade became the 129th (1/1st South Western) Brigade. However, the division, and the brigade, never saw action and were disbanded later in the war but many of the division's units saw service with mainly British Indian Army brigades and divisions. First World War order of battle 1/4th Battalion, Prince Albert's (Somerset Light Infantry) (until February 1916) 1/5th Battalion, Prince Albert's (Somerset Light Infantry) (until May 1917) 1/4th Battalion, Dorsetshire Regiment (until February 1916) 1/4th Battalion, Duke of Edinburgh's (Wiltshire Regiment) (until September 1917) Between the wars The Territorial Force was disbanded shortly after the end of the Great War. It was, however, reformed as the Territorial Army in 1920 and both the 43rd Division and the brigade were also reformed. The brigade was now known as 129th (South Western) Infantry Brigade, composed of the same battalions it had before the Great War and this was the composition of the brigade for most of the inter-war years. In 1938 all infantry brigades were reduced from four to three battalions and so, as a result, the 4th Battalion, Dorset Regiment was transferred to the 128th (Hampshire) Infantry Brigade. In 1939 the brigade was redesignated as 129th Infantry Brigade and the 4th Dorsets was transferred to the 130th Infantry Brigade. In the same year, the 5th Battalion, Wiltshire Regiment, formed as a 2nd Line duplicate of the 4th Wilts when the Territorials were doubled in size, also joined the brigade and the 5th Battalion, Somerset Light Infantry was transferred to 135th Infantry Brigade, part of 45th (Wessex) Infantry Division, which was formed as a 2nd Line duplicate of the 43rd (Wessex). Second World War The brigade served with the division throughout the Second World War and spent from 1939 until June 1944 in intensive training throughout the United Kingdom, particularly in Kent. They were training for the invasion of France and landed in Normandy in late June 1944. They fought in the Normandy Campaign, Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge and the Rhine Crossing.

{"text": "Hoplobatrachus tigerinus, commonly known as the Indian bullfrog, is a large species of fork-tongued frog found in South and Southeast Asia. A relatively large frog, it is normally green in color, although physiological traits vary between populations. Sexual dimorphism exists between males and females. Outside of its native range, H. tigerinus is a rapidly-spreading invasive species. Both adults and tadpoles can severely damage the populations of other frog species. Typically, Indian bullfrogs dwell in wetland environments. Research has been conducted on their ability to control mosquitos. Taxonomy The Indian bullfrog was first described by François-Marie Daudin in 1802, as Rana tigerina. The type locality was given as \"Bengale, India\". In 1992, it was transferred to the genus Hoplobatrachus by Alain Dubois, as Hoplobatrachus tigerinus. In addition to various other renditions and misspellings of R. tigerina, other synonyms include Rana picta, Dicroglossus tigrinus, and Euphlyctis tigerina. Description The Indian bullfrog is a large species of frog. They can grow to be , with heads generally longer than they are wide, although older individuals tend to have wider heads. Normally green or brown with dark spots, males turn yellow during the breeding season. They tend to have a yellow streak along the spinal region of their back. Significant variation, in both color and size, exists between different populations, even geographically close ones. A 2012 study found that frogs from different villages in the Jamshoro District of Sindh, Pakistan were consistently different in size and coloration from other local populations. The study suggested that this was caused by food and water quality differences, as well as varying ages. Their hands are unwebbed, while their feet are essentially fully webbed. Males have nuptial pads (swellings present on the forearms of certain male amphibians used to grasp females for mating) on the first finger and dual blue-colored vocal sacs on either side of the throat. The tail and fins of tadpoles are speckled in black, with tail tips darkly colored. In males, the tympanum is wider than the eye, while in females the eye is wider than the tympanum. Females are also heavier and longer than males. Distribution and habitat Distribution The Indian bullfrog is native to mainland Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan, as well as possibly Bhutan and China, although its presence is uncertain. It has been introduced to Maldives, Madagascar, and India's Andaman Islands, where it is now a widespread invasive species. Likely areas to be invaded in the future include the Mascarene Islands, Malaysia, Indonesia, and East Africa. Andaman Islands First reported in October of 2011, H. tigerinus has become a major threat to the fauna of the Andaman Islands. Larger than native frogs, it can easily consume large numbers of them, along with reptiles such as the Andaman worm snake and Andaman day gecko, as well as centipedes. The rapid spread of this frog throughout the archipelago is harmful to human residents as well, having disastrous effects on the local economy. The bullfrogs frequently kill and eat residents' fish and chicks, both of which are important to the islanders. While Indian law prohibits their killing, it is still done, both out of desire to rid the islands of the species and for food (H. tigerinus is a very cheap source of protein). Despite these efforts, the frogs' spread continues. One trait in particular that facilitates this invasion is the carnivorous nature of H. tigerinus tadpoles. Experimentation at the Andaman Nicobar Environment Team (ANET) field station on South Andaman Island demonstrated that when kept together in pools with adequate amounts of food, Indian bullfrogs rapidly devoured the tadpoles of native species. This behavior did not appear to increase their growth rate, the time it took to metamorphosize, or adult size. They consumed other tadpoles so quickly that no competitive behavior could be observed between different species. Even when kept only with their own kind, their aggression towards other tadpoles remained, with only three surviving per pool on average (for comparison, when kept without bullfrogs, native tadpoles—of the species Microhyla chakrapanii and Kaloula ghoshi—lived to metamorphosis three out of four times, on average). It is likely that the frog will eventually reach the Nicobar Islands. Madagascar The species was first introduced to Madagascar for food, for which it is still used, although it has now become a pest. Human consumption has not been enough to prevent its spread. Habitat Hoplobatrachus tigerinus is typically found in freshwater environments, especially wetlands, such as paddy fields. It is not generally found in other ecosystems, such as forests and coastal areas. Behavior and ecology Diet Adult Indian bullfrogs eat invertebrates, small mammals, and birds. Tadpoles are known to consume mosquito larvae, including those of the species Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. Reproduction and life cycle Hoplobatrachus tigerinus reproduce during the monsoon season, in pools of rainwater. They produce many eggs at one time, although many tadpoles die before reaching adulthood. They can live over seven years in the wild. Research The Indian bullfrog has been found to be an efficient means of controlling mosquito populations. Silver nanoparticles (AgNP), which are highly toxic to the larvae of Aedes aegypti (the yellow fever mosquito), were found to be able to work in conjunction with Hoplobatrachus tigerinus tadpoles to exterminate large numbers of mosquito larvae, with tadpoles consuming more AgNP exposed larvae than non-exposed ones. While AgNP did not cause any immediate harm to the tadpoles, potential long-term side effects (such as changes in life expectancy) have yet to be studied.

{"text": "Juan Manuel 'Juanma' Ortiz Palazón (born 1 March 1982) is a Spanish footballer who plays mainly as a right midfielder. After starting out at Atlético Madrid he went on to spend most of his professional career with Almería, appearing in 151 official matches over two spells (16 goals) whilst playing four La Liga seasons with the club. He also competed professionally in Scotland and Cyprus. Club career Early years Born in Guardamar del Segura, Province of Alicante, Valencia, Ortiz was a graduate of Atlético Madrid's youth system, where he played five first-team games during the 2003–04 season, three as a starter. He had previously made his debut with the main squad in the 2001–02 campaign, appearing in one Segunda División match as the Colchoneros were promoted, and would spend the next three years on loan at both CA Osasuna and Polideportivo Ejido, the latter in the second level. Almería For 2007–08, Ortiz joined newly promoted UD Almería, where he was instrumental in helping the Andalusia side overachieve to a final eighth place in La Liga. He scored two goals, including in a 4–1 away win against neighbours Sevilla FC on 19 April 2008, and continued to be regularly used in the following top-flight seasons, inclusively as an attacking right-back. Ortiz played as both right and left-back during the 2010–11 campaign. He netted twice in the Copa del Rey, both in a 4–3 victory over RCD Mallorca (8–6 on aggregate) in the round of 16, as the team eventually reached the competition's semi-finals for the first time in their history, being nonetheless relegated after ranking 20th and last. From 2007 to 2009, Ortiz was one of three Almería players with that surname, Mané and José Ortiz being the others. Rangers Ortiz signed for Scottish Premier League club Rangers on 6 July 2011, on a three-year contract. He made his first competitive appearance 17 days later, struggling to make an impact and playing out of position in a 1–1 away draw with Heart of Midlothian. He scored his first official goal on 18 August, in a UEFA Europa League qualifier against NK Maribor. On 30 January 2012, after a somewhat disappointing first half to his Rangers campaign, it was announced that Ortiz would rejoin Almería on loan until the end of the season. He netted three times in his first three games, awarding his team nine points after strikes against Córdoba CF (2–1, home), Girona FC (1–0, away) and Real Murcia (4–2, home). Return to Spain Following Rangers' liquidation after they entered administration, several players refused to have their contracts transferred to a new company set up by Charles Green, and both Ortiz and the club agreed on having his link terminated. On 10 July 2012, he signed a two-year contract with Granada CF. Having signed in the summer of 2014 at the age of 32, Ortiz then spent several seasons in the Cypriot First Division with AEK Larnaca FC, sharing teams with a host of compatriots. On 29 September 2017, he returned to his country and signed with amateurs CF La Nucía, helping to a first-ever promotion to the Segunda División B in 2019. Ortiz returned to Tercera División in December 2019, joining CF Intercity.

{"text": "John Ryman QC (7 November 1930 – 3 May 2009) was a British Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) who sat as an independent MP for his last year in the House of Commons. Ryman was educated at Leighton Park School, Reading, and Pembroke College, Oxford. Ryman was a barrister and a fox-hunter. He was elected MP for Blyth in the October 1974 general election, ousting the incumbent Eddie Milne (who had been re-elected as an Independent Labour MP at the February 1974 election after being deselected as the official Labour candidate). In 1976 was fined £400 in under the Representation of the People Act 1949 and the Perjury Act 1911 for falsifying his election expenses return and overspending, although the election result stood. In a close Parliament, Ryman's frequent absences from Parliament (either to continue his legal work or for other reasons) tried the patience of the whips. On one celebrated occasion the Chief Whip Bob Mellish went on the radio to ask listeners to get in touch if they had spotted him. When the German Social Democrat Helmut Schmidt urged the Labour Party to support British membership of the EEC, Ryman responded with \"Why should this patronising Hun lecture the British Labour Party?\" Ryman held off a strong challenge from Milne in the 1979 general election, holding his seat with a majority of over 7,000. The constituency was renamed Blyth Valley for the 1983 general election, when the newly formed Social Democratic Party (SDP) cut his majority to 3,243. In 1986, he announced that he was leaving the Labour Party and sat as an independent until he retired at the 1987 general election. His successor was Ronnie Campbell. On 23 April 1992 Ryman was convicted of defrauding two women of their life savings. He had pretended to be the director of a Swiss bank and told the women that they would get 22·5% interest, but in fact paid the money to his ex-wife for maintenance payments. Ryman was given a two-and-a-half-year jail sentence. Personal life Ryman was a former husband of Shirley Summerskill, another Labour MP. They married in 1957 but had divorced by the time he entered Parliament. He was married five times in all. He claimed to have invested some money belonging to his fifth wife Nicola, a wealthy widow, in a high-yield Swiss bank account but in fact squandered the money on a horse, Jaguar car and holidays on the Orient Express. He had previously narrowly escaped being prosecuted by the family of a mistress whose money he had also claimed to have invested in a Swiss account.

{"text": "Johnnie Hamp (sometimes referred to as John Hamp, or Johnny Hamp) is a British television producer, now retired. He is responsible for the early British television appearances of such acts as the Beatles, Burt Bacharach, Cannon and Ball, Paul Daniels, comedian Woody Allen and singer Lisa Stansfield as Head of Light Entertainment with Granada Television. Biography Early life and 1960s television As a small boy he toured variety theatres as a stooge to his father, a magician known as the Great Hampo. In 1949 he won several talent contests with his own act, a Danny Kaye Tribute, and then toured with The Brian Michie Discoveries Show. In 1950 he was conscripted for two years service in the Royal Air Force. During the 1950s he trained as a Granada cinema manager in Kingston, moving to the group's flagship venue at Tooting to handle a 1953 Frank Sinatra concert. He presented many more, firstly with Johnnie Ray, Guy Mitchell and Frankie Laine, and later with Tommy Steele, Cliff Richard and Gene Vincent. During this period he arranged personal appearances at Granada Theatres of many Hollywood stars including Jayne Mansfield, Bob Hope, Victor Mature etc. In 1956 Hamp joined Granada's television division, retaining his responsibilities for stage show management, and booking acts for television productions such as Chelsea at Nine. Granada boss Sidney Bernstein soon noticed Hamp's potential as a producer, and put him in charge of several television quiz shows including Spot the Tune, Criss Cross Quiz and Take A Letter. By the late 1960s Hamp was based at the new company headquarters in Manchester, where he was making the regional news magazine programme Scene at 6.30. This was followed by a successful series of television specials featuring blues based American artists. The shows included Sarah Sings and Basie Swings (1963), with Sarah Vaughan and Count Basie; I Hear the Blues (1963), featuring Memphis Slim, Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson and Willie Dixon; The Blues and Gospel Train (1964), with Sister Rosetta Tharpe; Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On (1964), with Jerry Lee Lewis and Gene Vincent; and It's Little Richard (1963). In addition, he championed the Beatles by giving the band television exposure in 1962, at a time when they were little known outside Liverpool. Hamp made three notable television specials during 1965: Woody Allen, The Bacharach Sound and The Music of Lennon & McCartney. In 1969 he took over as producer of the film programme Cinema, fronted by the young Michael Parkinson. The Comedians 1971 saw Hamp's peak of success with the series The Comedians (intermittently 1971–1985), which introduced innumerable new faces to the British public and kickstarted a number of solo comedy careers. These included Mike Reid, Charlie Williams, Colin Crompton, Mick Miller, George Roper, Stan Boardman and Bernard Manning. The series featured mainly Northern stand-up comedians drawn from the club circuit. It was a ratings success for Granada. In 1972/3 Hamp produced spectacular stage versions of 'The Comedians' which played weekly at major theatres and for long summer seasons at The London Palladium, Blackpool, Great Yarmouth and Clacton. Continuing in the Northern club tradition, The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club (1974–1976), a variety series set in a makeshift working men's club, was another success, often featuring many cast members from The Comedians. Other notable programmes and series include The International PopProms (1975), Paul Daniels Blackpool Bonanza (1978), Bernard Manning in Las Vegas (1978) and The Video Entertainers (1981). Retirement Hamp left Granada Television in 1987, to form his own independent production company, Johnnie Hamp Enterprises. He became the subject of This Is Your Life in 1992, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at Manchester's Victoria & Albert Hotel. In 2008, Hamp published his anecdotal autobiography It Beats Working for a Living. In December 2012, Hamp received 'The City of Manchester and Lord Mayor's Lifetime Achievement Award'. Now retired and still living in Manchester, Hamp concentrates on his love of oil painting, charity work and after-dinner speaking.

{"text": "Miguel Ángel de las Cuevas Barberá (born 19 June 1986) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Orihuela CF. A versatile midfield element, he can play both in the wings and behind the forwards, but usually occupies the attacking midfielder position. After starting out at Hércules, he went on to appear in 201 La Liga matches over eight seasons, totalling 18 goals for Atlético Madrid, Sporting de Gijón and Osasuna. He added 127 games in Segunda División (16 goals), and also spent one year in the Italian Serie B with Spezia. Club career Hércules Born in Alicante, Valencian Community, de las Cuevas started his professional career with hometown club Hércules CF, in the Segunda División B. In the 2004–05 season, he was instrumental as the team achieved promotion to the Segunda División after a six-year-absence. Atlético Madrid For the 2006–07 campaign, de las Cuevas signed a five-year contract with Atlético Madrid. During preseason, on 13 August, in the Teresa Herrera Trophy match against Club Nacional de Football, he suffered a serious ankle injury that kept him out of action for more than one year. De las Cuevas finally made his debut for the Colchoneros on 12 December 2007, playing the second half of a Copa del Rey away tie against Granada 74 CF, in the round of 32. He appeared in 13 La Liga matches in his first season after returning from injury, 12 as a substitute. Sporting Gijón On 25 June 2009, after producing slightly the same numbers with Atlético, de las Cuevas moved to fellow top-tier side Sporting de Gijón on a four-year deal. However, Atlético retained an option to rebuy in the first three. He had a breakthrough season in 2009–10, ranking second in goals in the team at eight; highlights included braces against RCD Mallorca (4–1), Athletic Bilbao (2–1, away) and one against former club Atlético (1–1) that certified Sporting's permanence in the top flight for a further year, on 8 May 2010. Still under manager Manuel Preciado, de las Cuevas was again an undisputed starter for Gijón in the 2010–11 campaign. On 2 April 2011, he scored the only goal in a win over Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, ending José Mourinho's record of nine years and 150 league matches unbeaten at home; he only missed one league game and netted six times, in another final escape from relegation. Osasuna De las Cuevas was loaned to CA Osasuna on 11 January 2013, thus returning to the top flight. The move was made permanent in late May after the Navarrese managed to retain their status, with a €1.2 million fee being paid in equal shares to Atlético and Sporting. Spezia On 29 January 2015, de las Cuevas terminated his contract that ran until June 2016, and moved abroad for the first time in his career at the age of 28, signing with Spezia Calcio in Italy. His first appearance in the Serie B occurred on 14 February, as he featured 73 minutes in a 0–0 draw at Carpi F.C. 1909. In late September 2015, de las Cuevas successfully underwent surgery to his heart after an anomaly was detected. He was sidelined for six months. Later career De las Cuevas returned to Osasuna on 1 February 2016, on a free transfer. He left the club in July 2018 after his contract expired, and signed a one-year deal with Córdoba CF on 31 August. De las Cuevas scored a career-best nine goals in 2018–19, but his team suffered relegation from the second tier. He continued to be first choice the following years.

{"text": "Fouad Boulemia, born in 1973, is a former guerrilla of the Armed Islamic Group, found guilty of killing Abdelkader Hachani and of participating in the Bentalha massacre. Biography Boulemia was a member of the Armed Islamic Group, an organisation fighting both the Algerian government and the Islamic Salvation Army and frequently targeting civilians, between the spring of 1995 and 1999. Abdelkader Hachani, a leading member of the Islamic Salvation Front, was assassinated on November 22, 1999, soon after being released from prison. In December the government announced that it had arrested Fouad Boulemia for his murder. Boulemia was sentenced to death on April 12, 2001 after a one-day trial. At the trial, he claimed to have been tortured by the secret services and threatened by General Toufik in person to force him to sign a confession that he now repudiated. This confession stated that, coincidentally finding himself in the dentist's waiting room with Hachani, he spontaneously decided to kill Hachani because Hachani was a leading figure of the Djaz'ara (Algerianisation) wing of the Islamic Salvation Front, and pulled out his weapon, shot Hachani, and ran away. In this trial, he was questioned neither by his lawyer, Maître Khemis, nor by the prosecutor. Two witnesses reported seeing Boulemia shoot Hachani, although one was reported to have previously claimed to have seen a man named Abdelaoui, with a quite different physical appearance, shoot Hachani. He was sentenced to death again on August 1, 2004 for taking part in the Bentalha massacre, where more than 200 villagers were killed by armed guerrillas. He was released from Serkadji prison on March 10, 2006 (Liberté 11 March 2006), shortly after the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation came into force.

{"text": "Felicja Blumental (28 December 1908 – 31 December 1991) was a Polish pianist and composer. \"She was one of the relatively few women born in the first quarter of the twentieth century to have achieved an important career as a concert pianist.\" Early life Felicja Blumental was born in Warsaw, Poland, into a Jewish musical family, daughter of a violinist. She began piano lessons at the age of five, and made her debut at the age of ten. She studied at the National Conservatory in Warsaw, taking piano lessons from Zbigniew Drzewiecki (who founded the International Frederick Chopin Piano Competition) and composition lessons from the composer Karol Szymanowski. She later studied privately in Switzerland with Józef Turczyński, a noted Chopin interpreter and scholar. Personal life In 1938, she and her husband Markus Mizne moved first to Nice, then to Brazil to escape the growing antisemitism in Europe. She became a Brazilian citizen, and for the rest of her life championed the music and composers of her adopted country. Her subsequent career saw her settling in Milan in 1962, then in 1973 in London. Musical career Blumental's repertoire was wide and adventurous, ranging from the Portuguese baroque to South American contemporary works. Her numerous recordings also included many forgotten concertos by composers such as Carl Czerny (Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 214), Ferdinand Ries (Piano Concerto in C-sharp minor, Op. 55) and John Field. Heitor Villa-Lobos wrote his Piano Concerto No. 5 for her; she was soloist at the world premiere on 8 May 1955, at the Royal Festival Hall, London, with the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Jean Martinon, and she also recorded the concerto in Paris, under the baton of the composer. Krzysztof Penderecki dedicated his Partita for harpsichord and orchestra to her. Her recording of this work won a Grand Prix du Disque of the Charles Cros Academy of France in 1975. Among her recordings was a boxed set of Beethoven's complete works for solo piano and orchestra, including two early works without opus number, as well as Beethoven's own arrangement for piano of his violin concerto. It is, however, her Chopin playing for which she will be most remembered. A pianist of considerable power, despite her diminutive size, her recordings of the Chopin mazurkas, in particular, are considered landmark interpretations. She died in 1991 in Israel, on one of her many concert tours of the country. She is buried in Tel Aviv's Kiryat Shaul Cemetery. Her daughter, the singer Annette Céline, was one of the organizers of the annual Felicja Blumental International Music festival until her death on 3 June 2017. Many of Blumental's recordings have been restored on Brana Records, and all CD covers feature the art prints of her husband Markus Mizne.

{"text": "Edward Capehart O'Kelley (October 1, 1857 – January 13, 1904) was an American murderer who killed Robert Ford, who had killed the famous outlaw Jesse James to receive a bounty. He was the subject of a 1994 book by his (O'Kelley's) great-great-niece. Over the years, historians and contemporary newspapers erroneously spelled O'Kelley's surname as \"Kelly\" or \"O'Kelly\", sometimes mistakenly using the letter \"O\" as his middle initial. Early years Little is known of O'Kelley's youth, although his birthplace is reported as Harrisonville, Missouri. His mother was Margaret Ann Capehart (July 6, 1836 – July 27, 1903), but at the time of her July 14, 1857, marriage to Dr. Thomas Katlett O'Kelley (October 20, 1833 – October 9, 1923) she was already pregnant with Edward. It is believed that Thomas was not Edward's father. Edward was a child during the American Civil War. In Thomas' Civil War Veteran Pension File, where Thomas was required to list all his children and their dates of birth, Edward is not included on the list. Murder of the Murderer Robert Ford Robert Ford befriended outlaw Jesse James in 1882, when he and his brother Charley joined his gang. They lived with James and his family for a time. Ford shot James in the back of the head to collect a state bounty of $5,000. By 1892, he operated a tent saloon in the silver mining camp of Creede, Colorado. On June 8, 1892, while Ford was preparing to open his saloon, O’Kelley walked into the tent with a shotgun. Ford was turned away from the front entrance. O’Kelley called out, \"Hello, Bob.\" As Ford turned around to see who spoke, O’Kelley fired his shotgun, hitting Ford in the neck and killing him instantly. O’Kelley never explained why he had shot Ford. According to one account, O’Kelley married a relative of the Younger Brothers Gang and became friends with Jesse James, who became a cousin by marriage. Another version contends that con man Soapy Smith assured O’Kelley he’d be famous if he killed Ford. One theory involves the accusation that O’Kelley had stolen Ford’s diamond ring, and the dispute had escalated. O’Kelley was initially imprisoned for life, though his sentence was later reduced to 18 years. In the end, O’Kelley served only around 9 years at the Colorado State Penitentiary before being released due, firstly, to a 7,000-signature petition in favor of his release, and, secondly, to a medical condition. After incarceration After his release, O'Kelley moved to Oklahoma City. Shortly after his arrival in town, he was recognized by Otto Ewing of the Southern Club, a local gambling house. It is claimed that Ewing had been connected with Ford's saloon in Creede, and may even have been there when O'Kelley killed Ford. Ewing told people that O'Kelley was a dangerous man and best avoided. In December 1903, police officer Joseph Grant \"Joe\" Burnett (1867–1917) arrested O'Kelley as a \"suspicious character\". O'Kelley was staying at the Lewis Hotel. He frequented the saloons on West 4th and 2nd Streets, which were known as the hangouts of criminals in the early years of the city. Personal life Nicknamed \"Red\", O'Kelley reportedly married a relative of the Younger brothers. Death On January 13, 1904, O'Kelley was arrested by a police officer named Bunker. O'Kelley was released and went to his hotel, where he commented to others that the police had better not try to arrest him again. That evening, Officer Burnett, who had arrested O'Kelley the previous month, was walking his beat on the south side of First Street, in front of the McCord & Collins building. Burnett encountered O'Kelley and greeted him politely. In reply, O'Kelley struck at the lawman and drew a revolver. As O'Kelley struck at the officer again, Burnett grabbed the gun with his left hand. The two men began to wrestle over the firearm. O'Kelley fired his pistol several times in an attempt to kill Burnett. The officer called out for help repeatedly. O'Kelley did not hit Burnett with his gunfire, but Burnett did receive powder burns on one ear. Once out of ammunition, O'Kelley bit chunks out of both of Burnett’s ears. A friend of O'Kelley came to his aid and fired one shot at the policeman, but then lost his nerve and ran away. R.E. Chapin witnessed the fight from the rear of the building on West Main Street and telephoned police headquarters. Finally, A.G. Paul, a railroad baggage man, came running from the depot. He grabbed O'Kelley's hand, thus freeing Burnett's gun hand. The policeman immediately fired two shots and killed O'Kelley. There were two bullet holes in the back of Burnett's overcoat, and the left hip pocket was torn by a bullet. By the time friends reached his side, Burnett's gloves were burned and his clothing was on fire. They called an ambulance to take O'Kelley's body to the morgue at Street and Harpers furniture store. His body had a bullet wound in his left leg just above the knee. The fatal shot entered his head just behind the left temple and exited behind the right ear. Burnett continued with the Oklahoma City Police Department, serving as a Captain and later as assistant Chief of Police. He died on July 20, 1917, of paralysis after a stroke, at St. Anthony's Hospital. Burnett was buried in a marked grave in the same cemetery as the man he killed. Memorial A monument for Edward O'Kelley stands in the Patton United Methodist Church cemetery, on Country Road 878, in Patton, Missouri. The monument is engraved on both sides. (It cites 1858 as the year of birth.) The front of the monument reads: Edward Capehart O'Kelley 1858 - January 13, 1904 Shot and killed Robert N. Ford, the murderer of Jesse James, in the Silver mining camp at Creede, Colorado. O'Kelley died in the streets of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in a gunfight with the law. The back of the memorial contains engraved scenes from 1890s Creede, Colorado, where O'Kelley fatally shot Ford. The monument was erected through the efforts of Judith Ries, O'Kelley's great-great niece. References Sources Rizzo, T. (June 8, 2020). \"day of retribution\". Tom Rizzo.

{"text": "(also sometimes spelled Voss Strasse or Vossstrasse in English); is a street in central Berlin, the capital of Germany. It runs east–west from Ebertstraße to Wilhelmstraße in the borough of Mitte, one street north of Leipziger Straße and very close to Potsdamer Platz. It is best known for being the location of Hitler's new Reich Chancellery complex, and the bunker where he spent his last days. History In the 18th and 19th centuries, the area was the site of several mansions owned by members of the Prussian aristocracy, some of which were taken over by government departments. One of these was the home of Ferdinand August Hans Friedrich von Voß-Buch (1788–1871), a Prussian military officer who was at one time commander of the \"Garde-Grenadier-Regiment Kaiser Alexander von Russland\" which was stationed in Berlin, and who retired with the rank of General in 1854 and became a Count in 1864. His home was the \"Marschall Palais\" in Wilhelmstraße (sometimes referred to as \"Palais Voß\" or the \"Voßsche Palais\"), built in 1736 by architect Philipp Gerlach (1679-1748) and demolished in 1872, the year after Voß-Buch's death, to allow the creation of the street which was to bear his name. (Another street under the same name in Berlin's district Tempelhof-Schöneberg was named after Johann Heinrich Voss). Among the notable buildings in the Voßstrasse in the mid-1930s were: On the north side, numbered from east to west: Voßstraße 1 - the Borsig Palais, on the corner of Wilhelmstraße, built in 1875–1877 on part of the site of the former Marshall Palais, for the German businessman and manufacturer Albert Borsig (1829–1878), son of locomotive engineer August Borsig, although he never actually moved into it and died a year after its completion 2 - the head office of Mitropa, a catering company which from 1916 until 2002 managed sleeping and dining cars throughout the German rail system 3 - the Embassy of Bavaria 4-5 - the Justice Ministry of the German Empire, Weimar Republic and Third Reich 6 - the head office of the German Reich Railway Co 10 - the Embassy of Württemberg 11 - the Nazi Party's Berlin offices 15 - the Bank of Delbrück Schickler & Co 19 - the Embassy of Saxony. On the south side, numbered from west to east: Voßstraße 20 - the former Reich Naval Office, which had relocated to the Bendlerblock in 1914 22 - the Mosse Palais, home of the German Jewish publishing tycoon Hans Lachmann-Mosse (1885–1944) 24-32 - the rear of the enormous Jewish-owned department store Wertheim 33-35 - more offices of the German Reich Railway Co. By the 1930s the latter had been taken over by the new Reich Ministry of Transport, which in its final form occupied an extensive range of buildings with facades in three streets (Voßstrasse, Leipziger Straße and Wilhelmstraße). Other addresses in Voßstrasse were mostly residential properties. In 1938 the entire north side of the street, except for the Borsig Palais (Voßstraße 1), was demolished to make way for the new Reich Chancellery building, built by Albert Speer for Adolf Hitler and opened in January 1939. Incorporating the Borsig Palais within its structure, the Chancellery extended back along the whole length of the Voßstrasse, a distance of 430 metres: its official address was Voßstraße 6. The building was severely damaged by Allied bombs in February 1945, and the ruins later demolished by the Soviet occupying forces. Hitler killed himself in the Führerbunker, a little further north, on 30 April 1945. From 7 October 1949, Voßstrasse was located in East Berlin, which did little to develop the Potsdamer Platz area as it was in the sensitive border zone, along which the Berlin Wall would eventually divide the city. By 1956 there was only one surviving building in the entire length of Voßstrasse - part of the German Reich Railway Co. offices (Voßstrasse 33). When the Berlin Wall went up in August 1961, much of Voßstraße became stranded in no-man's-land. Today, there is still little of note along the street, although it continues to attract curious visitors looking for the site of the Reich Chancellery and the Führerbunker. In the aerial photograph on the right, taken in December 2003, Voßstrasse runs from top to bottom just to the right of centre. The Reich Chancellery ran the full length of the north (left) side, up to Wilhelmstraße, the street running from left to right at the top of the picture. Today there are several GDR-era apartment blocks, built between 1986 and 1990, and some fenced-off waste land behind the apartment blocks along Wilhelmstraße. On the south (right) side of Voßstrasse, the sole-surviving pre-war building, part of the German Reich Railway Co. offices (Voßstraße 33), can be seen, mostly surrounded by the empty sites of the Wertheim department store and the rest of the Transport Ministry. Note also the concrete \"lid\" over the U-Bahn line. Legacy Some of the stones from the new Reich Chancellery on Voßstrasse were later used for the Soviet War Memorial in Berlin-Treptow.

{"text": "Diego Fuser (; born 11 November 1968) is an Italian former professional footballer, who played as a midfielder, mainly on the right wing, although he was also capable of playing in the centre. Fuser was a quick, hard-working, and energetic player, with good technique, and crossing ability, who excelled at making offensive runs down the right flank and assisting strikers with accurate crosses. A tenacious, and physically strong winger, he also possessed notable stamina, a powerful shot from distance, and was accurate from set-pieces. Club career Born in Venaria Reale, Province of Turin, Fuser started his professional career with Torino in 1986. He played 49 games for them before moving to A.C. Milan (1989–92). During his two seasons at Milan he collected a UEFA Champions League (1989) medal and a Scudetto (1988), as well as the 1989 European Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup titles. During his time at Milan, Fuser also spent time on loan at Fiorentina during the 1990–91 season, before completing a move to Lazio in 1992. This turned out to be arguably his most successful time in football becoming a fan favourite while playing 188 games in six years, scoring 35 goals and winning the Coppa Italia and reaching the UEFA Cup Final in 1998, as the club's captain. After moving to Parma in 1998 he won the UEFA Cup, the Coppa Italia and the Italian Super Cup in 1999. He wore the number 14 shirt and captained the team in their 3–0 1999 UEFA Cup Final victory over Olympique Marseille on 6 May. Fuser blotted his Lazio copybook by joining A.S. Roma in the summer of 2001, where he only played 15 games in two seasons, winning the 2001 Supercoppa Italiana, and managing second-place finishes in Serie A in 2002, and in the Coppa Italia in 2003. During the 2003–04 season he played for his original club Torino, in Serie B. In the lower leagues In 2004, he signed for A.S.D.C. Canelli, whom he helped to win its Eccellenza round during the 2005–06 season, earning promotion to Serie D. In 2008, together with fellow player and personal friend Gianluigi Lentini, he moved to Saviglianese, a Promozione amateur club of Piedmont. He played also for the amateur clubs of Canelli and Nicese, which he simultaneously coached. In 2012, he played for another amateur club of Piedmont, Colline Alfieri Don Bosco in Promozione. International career Fuser initially represented Italy at Under-21 level on 18 occasions between 1987 and 1990, scoring 2 goals; he was notably a member of the team that finished in third place at the 1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, under manager Cesare Maldini. He also played for the senior Italy national football team on 25 occasions between 1993 and 2000, scoring 3 goals, and he was a participant at the 1996 UEFA European Championship under manager Arrigo Sacchi, making 3 appearances as Italy were eliminated in the first found. He was also in Dino Zoff's provisional 26 man squad for UEFA Euro 2000 before missing the final cut. Personal life Diego Fuser is married to Orietta.

{"text": "Stijn Stijnen (; born 7 April 1981) is a Belgian retired professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper, and the current manager of Patro Eisden Maasmechelen. He played in 189 Belgian Pro League games during thirteen seasons, mainly with Club Brugge with which he won nine major titles, including two national championships. Club career Born in Hasselt, Limburg, Stijnen moved from K.S.C. Hasselt to Club Brugge KV in 2000, aged 19, and became the club's first stand-in for veteran Dany Verlinden – when the latter retired at 41, he backed up Tomislav Butina. On 18 April 2003, he made his debut in the league, in a 3–0 away win against K.R.C. Genk. However, his big breakthrough came in the 2005–06 season, when he replaced the injured Butina several times; some strong performances (including the UEFA Champions League 2–1 home loss to Juventus in the group stage) made him the undisputed first-choice onwards. In the 2006–07 campaign, Stijnen was between the posts as Brugge won the Belgian Cup 1–0 against Standard Liège, but the club only finished sixth in the domestic league. He never played in less than 31 league games in the following three seasons, but the Blue and Black did not manage to win any silverware. Stijnen retired in the 2013 summer at the age of 32, after two top flight seasons with Beerschot AC. He returned to youth club Hasselt subsequently, after being appointed director of football. International career Belgium manager René Vandereycken noticed Stijnen's performances at club level, and handed him his debut in a friendly against Saudi Arabia on 11 May 2006. In March 2007, before an UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier in Portugal, he reportedly claimed his teammates should take opponent star Cristiano Ronaldo out of the game in an early stage, by all means necessary; eventually the home side won 4–0, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring twice, and the Manchester United player accepted the Belgian's apologies. Stijnen retired from international play in October 2009, after collecting 30 caps.

{"text": "The GWK was a British car made in Maidenhead, Berkshire, between 1911 and 1931. It got its name from its founders, Arthur Grice, J. Talfourd Wood, and C.M. Keiller. The cars were unusual in using a friction drive system. Pre-war The prototype was made in a stable in Beckenham, Kent, and used a Coventry-Simplex engine, rear-mounted. The drive system involved the engine, which was mounted across the chassis, turning a disc on which a wheel could be moved from the periphery to the centre. Top speed was with the driven wheel furthest from the centre and reverse was obtained by moving it past the centre. A few examples were sold before the company moved to Datchet, Buckinghamshire in 1912. Proper production now started still using a water-cooled, Coventry-Simplex twin-cylinder engine of 1069 cc. 1,045 of the two-seat cars were made before the outbreak of World War 1 and a move to war work; this first stage of car production ended in mid-1915. A move was also made to the larger Cordwallis Works in Maidenhead in 1914. During the war the company was run by Grice as his partners were in the army. At the 1913 A.C.U. Six-Day trial, a GWK was one of three cars to finish (out of twelve starters), and it won the Gold medal in the four-wheel class. Post-war Grice left the company in 1920 to start the unsuccessful Unit car company leaving Wood and Keiller in charge. They re-introduced the pre-war model, now called the Type E, and a further 82 were made largely from left over parts. A new model, the Type F was introduced in 1919 and was front-engined with a 1368 cc four-cylinder engine, still by Coventry-Simplex, with shaft drive to the friction disc at the rear. It was not a good seller partly because of the noise from the transmission; the power of the larger engine was more than the friction drive design could accommodate. The Type H overcame most of the drive line problems but suffered from the reputation of its predecessor. About 1,700 of the Types F and H were made between 1919 and 1926. The company had not given up on the rear-engined idea and a new car, the Type J, appeared in 1922 but only a few were sold. It had a bonnet and radiator very similar to the front-engined cars. The final car, the type G of 1930 was also rear-engined, with the engine behind the rear axle, only a few were made. GWK's greatest days were before World War 1 and after 1918 financial success eluded them. They went into temporary liquidation in 1922 and Wood and Keiller left but Grice returned in 1923. No cars seem to have been made between 1926 and 1930 and very few of the Type G were produced. The company finally closed in 1931 with the Cordwallis factory being used by Streamline Cars Ltd and later Marendaz. GWK also sold an imported Belgian Imperia car between 1924 and 1928 as the British Imperia. There were plans to build the Imperia at Maidenhead but these came to nothing.

{"text": "Tso Moriri or Lake Moriri () or \"Mountain Lake\", is a lake in the Changthang Plateau (literally: northern plains) of Ladakh in India. The lake and surrounding area are protected as the Tso Moriri Wetland Conservation Reserve. The lake is at an altitude of . It is the largest of the high altitude lakes entirely within India and entirely within Ladakh in this Trans-Himalayan biogeographic region. It is about 16 miles (26 km) north to south in length and two to three miles (3 to 5 km) wide. The lake has no outlet at present and the water is brackish though not very perceptible to taste. The lake is fed by springs and snow-melt from the adjacent mountains. Most water enters the lake in two major stream systems, one entering the lake from the north, the other from the southwest. Both stream systems include extensive marshes where they enter the lake. It formerly had an outlet to the south, but this has become blocked and the lake has become an endorheic lake. The lake is oligotrophic in nature, and its waters are alkaline. Accessibility to the lake is largely limited to summer season, though Karzok on the northwest shore and the military facilities on the eastern shores have year-round habitation. Tourism Karzok has homestays, Buddhist monastery and lake tourism. Topography As per a classification of the Himalayan Lakes done on the basis of their origin, there are four groups and Tso Moriri falls under the third group of \"remnant lakes\". The classification as reported states: (i) Glacial lakes which are formed in and around glaciers; (ii) Structural lakes, formed by folds or faults due to movements in earth’s crust (e.g. Nainital lake in Uttarakhand), (iii) Remnant lakes which were originally structural but represent the remnants of vast lakes (e.g., Tso Moriri, Tso Kar, Pangong Tso in Ladakh, and Dal Lake in Kashmir), (iv) Natural dammed lakes i.e., temporary water bodies formed along the river courses due to deposition of rocks or debris e.g. Gohna Tal in Garhwal, Uttarakhand. The Changthang Plateau in the eastern Ladakh represents a landscape of low productive ecosystems which protects unique floral and faunal species. The area is an extension of the western Tibetan plateau that lies above msl and supports diverse but low populations of several globally threatened mammals. The lake's basin could also be categorised as a basin since it is a closed drainage basin that retains water and allows no outflow to other bodies of water such as rivers or oceans. The lake is 20 to 50 kilometers southeast of the elevated valley of the core Rupshu Valley and falls within the greater Rupshu Plateau and valley area. The lake is ringed by mountains rising over , including Mentok Kangri and Lungser Kangri. \"Changpa\", the nomadic migratory shepherds (pastoral community) of yak, sheep, goat, and horses of Tibetan origin and who are engaged in trade and work on caravans in Ladakh region, are the main inhabitants of the area. Changpa (Champa) herders use the land of this valley as grazing ground and for cultivation. The Working Report (2006) of the Planning Commission of the Government of India also reports: Despite a poor vegetation cover, relatively low standing biomass and high anthropogenic pressure, this area sustains a considerably high livestock population. Steady increase in the livestock population in the area is mainly attributed to influx of nomadic herders from Tibet during recent decades and promotion of Pashmina goat production by the Animal Husbandry Department (AHD) for fine quality under wool (Pashmina). The herders and AHD officials, in recent years have begun to raise concern over degradation of pastures, resultant shortage of forage, and mass mortality of livestock during severe winters. The Korzok Monastery, on the western bank of the lake is 400 years old and attracts tourists and Buddhist pilgrims. Tourism during May – September attracts large number of foreign and local tourists even though tented accommodation is the facility available, apart from a small PWD guest house close to the Lake. Northeast of Tso Moriri is a small lake which is known locally as Lake of Joy. Access The lake is located to the southeast of Leh in eastern Ladakh, at a road distance of . The road is in a good condition for the most part. One can also reach Tsomoriri directly from the Pangong Tso via the remote Changtang region. This is considered to be one of the most beautiful drives in the entire Ladakh region. Foreigners are not allowed to go beyond the Man - Merak villages on Pangong Tso as permits are not issued for them. The distance between Pangong Tso and Tso Moriri is 235 km and there are no petrol pumps in the area. Carrying enough fuel is therefore necessary. Leh is also connected by air with many destinations in India. Hydrology and water quality The lake, with water spread area of is enclosed by peaks exceeding 6,000 meters on both the east and west sides. On the south, a nearly flat valley connects with but does not drain into or out of the Pare Chu river which is part of Sutlej river basin. Lingdi Nadi, major tributary of Tso Moriri, drains western catchment area of the lake and joins the lake on its south side. This valley contains the Nuro Sumdo wetlands (with a catchment area of ), a boggy area that mostly drains into the Pare Chu. Several small mountain streams feed the lake, including one through pasture land at Peldo Le. The lake is fed by springs and snow melt and has a maximum depth of . Aridity and cold desert conditions prevail in the lake region; with summer temperature varying from 0° to 30 °C (32° to 86 °F) and winter temperature recording −10° and −40 °C (14° to -40 °F). Geologically the lake is in Ordovician rock. Fauna and flora An avifaunal survey of the lake and its adjoining Nuro Sumdo wetland conducted in July 1996 revealed the following facts: Avifauna Thirty-four species of birds included 14 species of water birds (some are pictured in the gallery) of which following are the vulnerable species Black-necked cranes (Grus nigricollis) endangered. Bar-headed geese (Anser indicus)– only breeding ground in India Brown-headed gulls (Larus brunnicephalus) Great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus) Ferruginous pochard Black-necked grebe (Podiceps nigricollis) Mammals Tibetan gazelle, Procapra picticaudata, Goa antelope (threatened) Eurasian lynx Nayan Ovis ammon hodgsoni Bharal (Pseudois nayaur) Himalayan blue sheep Tibetan Ass (Kiang) or Equus kiang, endemic to the Tibetan Plateau Great Tibetan Sheep One species of marmot, Marmota himalayana in large numbers seen on the hill slopes surrounding the lake and also along the roadsides One species of hare, Lepus oistolus One species of vole, Alticola roylei Three species of mouse hares, Ochotona macrotis, Ochotona curzoniae or Tibetan sand fox and Scincella ladacensis Large carnivores Carnivores fauna reported are: the snow leopard (Uncia uncia) the Tibetan wolf (Canis lupus chanco) Vegetation While the deeper parts of the lake have no vegetation, the shallow areas are reported to have Potamogeton sps. Marshes have several species of sedges and reeds, particularly Carex, Caragana and Astragalus sps., which are all representative of the surrounding arid steppe vegetation. Details of the Vegetation recorded in the area comprises the following: Characteristic Caragana and Astragalus species Potamogeton species Several species of Carex, Primula (low growing herb), and Pedicularis(parasitic plant) Common species of Juncus thomsonii and Leontopodium sp Phytoplankton species of Oocystis with density was 900 cells/L to a depth of . Specimens of the diatom Cyclotella also recorded. Pastures for domestic livestock Ramsar site Largely based on the ecological diversity of the Lake (explained in the previous section) and its surroundings, the Tsomiriri was notified in November 2002 under the List of Ramsar Wetland sites under the Ramsar Convention. The justification could be summarized as: The faunal collection is unique and has a large variety with endemic and vulnerable species The herbivore species are also endemic to the region The lake plays a fundamental role as breeding grounds and key staging posts on migration routes for several water birds belonging to six families, which is distinctive of wetland diversity and productivity Threats to the lake There are a number of threats to the Lake, such as: Increase in the number of tourists visiting the lake affecting the breeding of avifauna Additional road construction along the lake Pasture degradation affecting wildlife, particularly wild herbivores (marmots, hares, ungulates) An increase in the grazing of sheep in the wetlands surrounding the lake The absence of a proper garbage disposal facility at the lake. Dogs kept by the people who live near the lake are known to attack the cranes and destroy their eggs. Jeep safaris have been known to chase wildlife such as kiang and approach close to the breeding ground. Lack of regulations and monitoring by the government. Conservation efforts The need for evolving a strategy and an action plan to preserve the extreme fragility of the lake ecosystem has been recognized with the needed emphasis at the National and International level to develop the lake conservation activity with participation of all stakeholders. The actions initiated in this direction are: Tso Moriri is an administratively declared Wetland Reserve. Legally, shooting wildlife is prohibited. The State Department of Wildlife has set up a check post near Mahe Bridge at the entrance towards the lake. WWF-India Project has established a field office at Korzok on the northwest shore of Tso Moriri for ‘Conservation of High Altitude Wetlands in Ladakh Region’ to carry out surveys, interact with tourists, tour guides, act as information centre and conduct education awareness programmes for locals, tourists etc. Wildlife Institute of India has also set up a field station at Leh to carry out scientific research in the region. Nature clubs have been set up and Information booklet on the lake published. Efforts of WWF – India has also resulted in the local community declaring Tso Moriri as a ‘Sacred Gift for a Living Planet’ during the Annual Conference held in Nepal in November 2000. Some of the other achievements so far reported on the Lake's conservation are: Regulation in consultation with local community Vehicular traffic flow and parking has been restructured with restriction of camping sites around the lake The Indo Tibetan Border Patrol (ITBP), tour operators and local population have introduced regular garbage cleanup operations Korzok community living around the lake has voluntarily built traditional and social fencing around the wetland to protect breeding and feeding grounds from vehicular traffic Tso Moriri Conservation Trust has been set up. Twenty Nature Clubs have been registered in different schools in Ladakh The Indian Army has committed to support and set up a Nature Interpretation Centre at 'Hall of Fame', Leh.

{"text": "Kassel conversations () is the conventional name of an early medieval text preserved in a manuscript from c. 810. It is held today in the university library of Kassel, Germany (Ms. 4° theol. 24). It contains several parts, among them an , an instructional theological text in Latin. The part that has been of most interest for modern scholarship is that of the so-called Kassel glosses, one of the earliest written documents of the Old High German language. The Kassel glosses are a collection of words and short phrases translated from Latin to Old High German. They appear to have been meant as a practical tool to help speakers of Romance languages to learn Old High German. Among them are everyday phrases such as orders given to servants (\"shave my beard\"), questions and answers for basic communication (\"do you understand? No, I don't\"), and a few fragmentary grammar paradigms (\"I understand, you understood, we understood\"). The most famous entry, however, is a jocular jibe in Latin and Old High German: Latin: Old High German: Translation: \"Roman () people are stupid, Bavarians are smart; there is little smartness in the Romans; they have more stupidity than smartness.\" The manuscript is written on 60 sheets of parchment. Based on the scribal hands and the forms of the Carolingian minuscule employed, it is believed that the text was written by two different scribes from the area of Regensburg c. 810. Parts of the text have a parallel in a second manuscript held in St. Gallen, Switzerland. The manuscript came to Kassel from Fulda in 1632. It was mentioned for the first time by Johann Heinrich Hottinger in his work from 1637. The first scholarly study of the manuscript was done by Wilhelm Grimm in 1846. Grimm made the mistake of re-drawing the text with a modern ink to make the writing more legible. This has caused some permanent damage to the fragile material.

{"text": "Sir Paul Elmore Oliver Bryan (3 August 1913 – 11 October 2004) was a British Conservative politician. Early life Bryan was born in Karuizawa, Japan, the seventh of nine children of The Rev Ingram Bryan. He lived in Japan until he was eight and then returned to England and was educated at St John's School, Leatherhead. He studied Modern Languages at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he took great interest in sport, playing cricket and rugby – he was scrum half in the college rugby team where he played alongside his friend Iain Macleod, the future Conservative Chancellor. After graduating he worked in Halifax, Yorkshire, where he met his first wife Betty Hoyle. They married in 1939. Military career Paul Bryan had a distinguished wartime career. He served with the Royal West Kent Regiment during World War II. He entered as a private soldier and attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel gaining the Military Cross and the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). In 1942 he fought first in North Africa as part of the Torch Landings. He was given command of 6th Battalion for the invasion of Sicily and then Italy in September 1943. For his \"outstanding\" leadership shown in the capture of Centuripe, Bronte and Monte Rivoglia in Sicily, he was awarded a DSO. After leading his battalion at Monte Cassino, he finished the war as commandant of a training unit established at Barmouth, Wales. Here he brought his wartime colleagues Denis Forman and Fred Majdelaney as instructors. Political career After the war he worked in Sowerby Bridge where he started to take an interest in politics. He contested Sowerby in 1949, 1950 and 1951. In 1955 he became Member of Parliament for Howden in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and later for Boothferry from 1983 until he retired in 1987. In 1956, Edward Heath, then Chief Whip, invited him to become a whip. He was vice-chairman of the Conservative Party 1961–65, a whip 1956 and 1958–61, and Minister for Employment from 1970 to 1972. Bryan was one of the first Tory MPs after the Labour victories of 1974 to suggest openly that it was time for Edward Heath to resign. In the leadership contest of 1975, he served on William Whitelaw's campaign committee. He was captain of the Parliamentary Golf Society and vice-chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee from 1977 to 1987.

Having been brought up in The Far East he took a great interest in Japan and China. He was chairman of the All-Party Hong Kong Parliamentary Group from 1974 to 1987. He made many friends among political leaders and businessmen both in the colony and in mainland China. He took Chris Patten on his first visit to Hong Kong and later took great interest in the negotiations for the transfer of the colony to China. He took a practical approach to the negotiations. He had immense sympathy for the people of Hong Kong but believed that a handover to China was unavoidable; at the same time, he remained optimistic about the prospects for the colony under Chinese rule. Personal life He had three daughters: Dr Elizabeth Bryan, a paediatrian; Felicity Bryan, a literary agent and writer; and Bernadette Hingley who was one of the first women priests in the Church of England. In 1971 he married Cynthia Duncan, daughter of Sir Patrick Ashley Cooper and the widow of Patrick Duncan and gained four stepchildren: Patrick, Alex, Ann and Emma Duncan. He had a passion for golf which he learned from his first father-in-law James Hoyle. He played regularly at Ganton Golf Course until his last years. He was President of Ganton Golf Club. While he never considered himself a good golfer, he gained fame in 1962 by hitting two holes-in-one in one round. After his death, members of the club placed a bench, inscribed with his name, on the course from which you can see both the holes. He became a Knight Bachelor in 1972.

{"text": "Soissons Cathedral (French: Cathédrale Saint-Gervais-et-Saint-Protais) is a Gothic basilica church in Soissons, France. It is the seat of the Bishop of Soissons, Laon, and Saint-Quentin. The construction of the south transept was begun about 1177, and the lowest courses of the choir in 1182. History The choir, with its original three-storey elevation and extremely tall clerestory, was completed in 1211. This was earlier than Chartres, on which the design was supposed to have been based. Work then continued into the nave until the late 13th century. The single western tower dates from the mid-13th century and is an imitation of those of Notre-Dame de Paris, which it equals in height (). The tower was restored after it and part of the nave were severely damaged in World War I. A matching tower on the other side of the façade was originally planned, but never built. Description The graceful southern transept, the oldest portion of the whole edifice, terminates in an apse. Unlike the rest of the building, it is divided inside into four (rather than three) levels. The choir end of the cathedral contains stained glass from the 13th century. A tapestry from the 15th century depicts the life of the martyrs Gervasius and Protasius, the patron saints of the cathedral. Rubens' Adoration of the Shepherds hangs in the northern transept, as does a painting by Philippe de Champaigne. Maurice Duruflé composed his work for organ \"Fugue sur de la Cathédrale de Soissons\" op. 12 (1962) Some stained glass windows from the Cathedrale de Soissons are on permanent exhibit at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. 2017 Storm Damage On January 12, 2017, during a winter storm, strong winds collapsed in a significant portion of the west rose window. Large stone pieces of the window's tracery and sections of stained glass fell onto the tracker-action pipe organ located below the rose window, causing severe damage to the instrument.

{"text": "Cambridge Rugby Union Football Club or CRUFC ('The Blood & Sand') is an English rugby union club representing the city of Cambridge. Formed in 1923, the club competes in the second tier of the English rugby union system, the RFU Championship, following promotion from National League 1 in 2022–23. The club plays its home matches at the 1,500 capacity Grantchester Road ground, in the suburb of Newnham, approximately two kilometres south-west of the city centre. The club runs three senior squads: the national league squad, a development squad, and a social squad. At junior level the club runs one of the oldest mini and youth rugby sections in the country, starting back in the early 1970s, with a colts team for under-18s. History Cambridge RUFC was formed in 1923 and was settled in its current ground by the 1950s. In 1993 the club was offered the opportunity to buy the lease on its existing three pitches and to buy adjoining land for a further three pitches from King's College. Floodlights were added to one of these pitches in 2003 so that evening games might be played and the light available for training was improved. Cambridge RUFC joined the newly formed league structure in 1988 and by 1991 was playing in London 3 North East. After five years in this division, the club was promoted to London 2 North and after four years in this division, was promoted at the end of the 1998–99 season to London 1, which feeds into the National Leagues. In the Club's first season in London 1, they achieved 4th place, plus a run to the semi-final of the NPI Cup, falling just one match from Twickenham, after defeat away at Hull by 21–17. London 1 status was secured again for the 2001–02 Season, but the squad led to relegation at the end of that season. However, by the end of the 2003–04 season, a rebuilt side regained promotion to London 1. Cambridge also won the Eastern Counties Cup for the first time and regained the Cambridgeshire Cup from perennial rivals Shelford. This time, the stay in London 1 was to be even shorter; At the end of an exciting season the League championship lay between Worthing and Cambridge at the start of the final round of matches: Worthing at home to Canterbury and Cambridge at home to Basingstoke. The championship would go to the team achieving the greatest points difference. In the event, Cambridge won by 96–15 and Worthing were condemned to the play-offs. Cambridge went on to beat Norwich in the Eastern Counties Cup Final and Shelford in the Cambridgeshire Cup Final — the second successive treble, and promotion to National League rugby for the first time. In the 2005–06 season Cambridge once again secured promotion after a two horse race. This time with Norfolk & East Anglian Giants North Walsham who had been present in this league for well over a decade. Cambridge squeezed past them with a last day win at Reading while North Walsham failed by 21–20 at Southend. This was all the more lucky as North Walsham had secured the bonus point for four tries but failed with all four conversions. In the 2006–07 season Cambridge managed to consolidate their position in National Division Two with a 9th-place finish. In the 2008–09 season Cambridge finished second in the league and would have been promoted had it not been for the re-organisation of the leagues in mid season. Current season League history Overall Players A number of players have gone on to gain International rugby honours, including Dickie Jeeps (England and British Lions), Andy Hancock (England), Bob Steven (Scotland), Trefor Evans (Wales), Simon Culhane New Zealand, including appearances in the 1995 World Cup Finals, and Alex Goode (England). Many more have earned age grade or England Counties caps. In 2014 Martin Wolfenden represented Zimbabwe in the qualifying competition for the Rugby World Cup. The club's most capped player is the late Shaun Gadsby who made 505 appearances for the club, his last being in the 2003/04 season aged 40.

{"text": "Miroslav Đukić (, ; born 19 February 1966) is a Serbian former footballer who played as a sweeper, and a manager. He spent 14 years of his professional career in Spain, notably at the service of Deportivo de La Coruña and Valencia, amassing La Liga totals of 368 games and 11 goals and winning a combined six major titles for the two teams. Đukić represented FR Yugoslavia in one World Cup and one European Championship. After retiring, he embarked in a managerial career at both club and international level. Playing career Club Born in Šabac, Socialist Republic of Serbia, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Đukić began his playing career with FK Mačva Šabac, moving in 1988 to Belgrade with FK Rad after reported interest from both national giants FK Partizan and Red Star Belgrade. In the middle of 1990, Đukić signed for Deportivo de La Coruña in Spain, who purchased him for 40 million pesetas in 1990. He only appeared in five league games for the Galicians in his first season, which ended in La Liga promotion, but, from there onwards, became an undisputed starter, never totalling less than 35 matches and 3,000 minutes of action in five consecutive campaigns, as Super Depor was coming to fruition. On 14 May 1994, in the league's last round, at home against Valencia CF, Đukić missed a penalty kick in the game's last minute (eventual 0–0 draw), as habitual taker Donato had already been replaced and second option Bebeto refused the responsibility since he failed to score one the previous match. As a result, FC Barcelona were crowned champions instead, and the elegant defender left A Coruña at the end of 1996–97 at the age of 31 as his contract was not renewed. Subsequently, Đukić joined Valencia, starting in all of the league games he took part in his first three seasons and helping the Che to two consecutive UEFA Champions League finals, both lost. Already as a backup, he made 16 appearances as the club won the first national championship in 31 years in 2002. Đukić returned to Segunda División after 12 years for the last season of his career, playing for CD Tenerife and retiring at the age of 38, having appeared in exactly 400 matches in the Spanish league (both major levels combined). International Đukić made his debut for Yugoslavia on 27 February 1991, in a 1–1 friendly draw against Turkey in İzmir. He went on to win 48 caps scoring twice, and represented the newly formed FR Yugoslavia at UEFA Euro 2000 (all the games and minutes for the quarter-finalists). Đukić was also a member of the squad that competed at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, but did not play due to injury. Coaching career Club On 23 January 2007, Đukić was named head coach of Partizan, being eventually voted Manager of the Year. On 11 June 2009 he signed for R.E. Mouscron in Belgium, replacing Enzo Scifo and being joined at the Pro League team by former Valencia teammates Amedeo Carboni and Juan Sánchez, who acted as sporting director and technical director, respectively; all left shortly after, as the club folded due to severe economical problems. In late March 2011, Đukić became Hércules CF manager after Esteban Vigo was sacked. His first match in charge was a 3–1 away win against Real Sociedad, but the Valencians ultimately suffered top-flight relegation. On 6 July 2011, Đukić was appointed at another second division side, agreeing to a three-year contract with Real Valladolid. In early June 2013, after leading them to promotion in his first season – via the playoffs – and the 14th position in the second, he replaced Ernesto Valverde at the helm of former club Valencia. Đukić was relieved of his duties on 16 December 2013, following the team's eighth loss of the season, 3–0 at Atlético Madrid which left it in ninth place. He was revealed as the new Córdoba CF manager on 20 October 2014, succeeding Albert Ferrer. On 23 January 2017, Đukić became the head coach of Al Shabab, but was forced out after the club merged with Al Ahli to form Shabab Al Ahli. In June 2017, Đukić returned to Partizan after replacing Videoton FC-bound Marko Nikolić. During his second spell at the Partizan Stadium he made several controversial statements, starting in March 2018 when he used profanities at a press conference, saying that he \"was born in fucking Štitar and not sunny Valencia\" and that he was \"a bum like all of you here.\" In May, he said \"if Marko Janković manages to overcome the Montenegrin in him, he will be a great player\"; in July, he referred to the team of FK Trakai as not being \"some Indians with feathers.\" Đukić came back to the Spanish second tier on 22 December 2019, taking the helm of Sporting de Gijón. Following a 13th-place finish, he was replaced by David Gallego the following July. International Đukić earned his coaching license in Spain, and started his new career with Serbia's under-21 team, which he led to the final of the 2007 UEFA European Championship, lost against hosts Netherlands. This arrived after a dramatic play-off qualification (3–0 home loss against Sweden, followed by a 5–0 away win).

{"text": "Darko Kovačević (; born 18 November 1973) is a Serbian former professional footballer who played as a forward. He began his career in Serbia with Proleter Zrenjanin and subsequently played for Red Star Belgrade, with whom he won a Yugoslav League title and two Yugoslav Cups. His prolific performances earned him a move to Premier League side Sheffield Wednesday, although his time in England was less successful. He is mainly known for his spells at Real Sociedad where his offensive partnership with Nihat Kahveci was one of the best in Spain. Kovačević also had positive spells with Italian club Juventus and Greek side Olympiacos. Internationally, he represented Yugoslavia at the 1998 FIFA World Cup and at the UEFA Euro 2000. Club career Proleter and Red Star Belgrade Beginning his career with his hometown club FK Radnički Kovin, he was soon spotted by Zrenjanin-based top league club FK Proleter Zrenjanin. Spending two seasons with the club, Kovačević managed over a goal every other game, was signed by Serbian giants Red Star Belgrade. Kovačević won a Yugoslav League title and two Yugoslav Cups, earning a call-up to the Yugoslavia national team. Sheffield Wednesday Kovačević was then signed by Premier League club Sheffield Wednesday in December 1995 valued at £2.5m in a joint £4.5m transfer also involving Dejan Stefanovic. Darko's notable goals for The Owls were two against Bolton Wanderers at Hillsborough and an important finish versus Liverpool, also at home. Darko played the remainder of the 1995/96 season but his failure to adapt and settle into the UK way of life prompted a bid of £2.5m from Real Sociedad to be accepted. A % sell-on clause in the transfer agreement ensured Sheffield Wednesday received a further £2.0m (taking the transfer to £4.5m) when Real Sociedad later sold him to Juventus. Real Sociedad Kovačević moved to La Liga side Real Sociedad in 1996. Larger clubs soon came calling, with Italian giants Juventus acquiring the big Serbian in the summer of 1999 for 33 billion lire (£12 million). Juventus and Lazio At Juventus, Kovačević found goals in both the Serie A and competitions such as the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup becoming their leading European goal scorer, and the top-scorer of the UEFA Cup during the 1999–2000 season, with 10 goals; despite facing competition from the club's starting attacking partnership of Filippo Inzaghi and Alessandro Del Piero, Kovačević made a total of 44 appearances in all competitions in his first season with the club (27 in Serie A, 3 in the Coppa Italia, and 11 in European competitions), scoring 21 goals in all competitions (eight in Serie A, two in the Coppa Italia, and 11 in European competitions, one of which came in Juventus's victorious UEFA Intertoto Cup campaign, which enabled them to qualify for the UEFA Cup). The following season, due to the arrival of French striker David Trezeguet, Kovačević found less space in the squad under manager Carlo Ancelotti, making 27 appearances in all competitions (20 of which came in Serie A), mostly from the bench, and scoring only six goals (five in Serie A). The Juventus management felt Kovačević was underachieving and soon both parties were looking for a move out of Italy, with clubs such as Rangers willing to offer £12m for his transfer. In 2001 Kovačević spent a brief time with Lazio (as part-swap deal with Marcelo Salas), making only seven appearances, before moving back to Spain in the middle of the season. Return to Real Sociedad In 2001 Kovačević returned to Real Sociedad, where he spent 6 more seasons at the club, netting 51 goals in his second spell with Sociedad. The 2006–07 season would be Kovačević's last season with the Spanish side, ending in the club's relegation. Alongside Jesús María Satrústegui, Kovačević is Real Sociedad's all-time top goalscorer in European club competitions, with 10 goals. Darko Kovacevic scored 107 goals in his stages with Real Sociedad in 9 seasons, with a total average of between 11 and 12 goals per season. They are only surpassed by Jesús María Satrústegui and López Ufarte in the txuri-urdin team. He is until today, the most efficient foreigner that Real Sociedad has had in all its years of existence. Olympiacos In 2007 Kovačević signed with Greek champions Olympiacos. In early 2009, he was diagnosed with a blocked artery; he successfully underwent heart surgery to improve the flow of blood to his heart. His doctors advised to retire from football, and Kovačević officially retired in May 2009, playing a final friendly match for Olympiakos to celebrate the winning of the Greek domestic double. With Olympiacos, Kovačević won two Greek SuperLeague titles, two Greek Cups and a Greek Super Cup. International career Kovačević made 59 appearances for the then Serbia and Montenegro. Beginning his international career in 1994, Kovačević would go on to score 10 goals and compete in both UEFA Euro 2000 and the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Style of play A quick and powerful striker, with good movement, technique, and an eye for goal, Kovačević's key attributes were his strength and aerial ability. After retirement After his retirement Kovačević stated that he may take another role for his former team Olympiacos. Kovačević and family subsequently returned to Spain. However, Kovačević returned to Greece as he loved the country and worked for several months as a columnist. In June 2010 the new president of Olympiakos, Evangelos Marinakis, hired Kovacevic as a Chief Scout for the club; he eventually become the sports director for the club. He remained in that position until 2018. He is the current sports director of the Serbian Football Association. Personal life Kovačević has three children, Mia, Darko (Jr.) and Stella.

{"text": "Flux limiters are used in high resolution schemes – numerical schemes used to solve problems in science and engineering, particularly fluid dynamics, described by partial differential equations (PDEs). They are used in high resolution schemes, such as the MUSCL scheme, to avoid the spurious oscillations (wiggles) that would otherwise occur with high order spatial discretization schemes due to shocks, discontinuities or sharp changes in the solution domain. Use of flux limiters, together with an appropriate high resolution scheme, make the solutions total variation diminishing (TVD). Note that flux limiters are also referred to as slope limiters because they both have the same mathematical form, and both have the effect of limiting the solution gradient near shocks or discontinuities. In general, the term flux limiter is used when the limiter acts on system fluxes, and slope limiter is used when the limiter acts on system states (like pressure, velocity etc.). How they work The main idea behind the construction of flux limiter schemes is to limit the spatial derivatives to realistic values – for scientific and engineering problems this usually means physically realisable and meaningful values. They are used in high resolution schemes for solving problems described by PDEs and only come into operation when sharp wave fronts are present. For smoothly changing waves, the flux limiters do not operate and the spatial derivatives can be represented by higher order approximations without introducing spurious oscillations. Consider the 1D semi-discrete scheme below, where, and represent edge fluxes for the i-th cell. If these edge fluxes can be represented by low and high resolution schemes, then a flux limiter can switch between these schemes depending upon the gradients close to the particular cell, as follows, where is the low resolution flux, is the high resolution flux, is the flux limiter function, and represents the ratio of successive gradients on the solution mesh, i.e., The limiter function is constrained to be greater than or equal to zero, i.e., . Therefore, when the limiter is equal to zero (sharp gradient, opposite slopes or zero gradient), the flux is represented by a low resolution scheme. Similarly, when the limiter is equal to 1 (smooth solution), it is represented by a high resolution scheme. The various limiters have differing switching characteristics and are selected according to the particular problem and solution scheme. No particular limiter has been found to work well for all problems, and a particular choice is usually made on a trial and error basis. Limiter functions The following are common forms of flux/slope limiter function, : CHARM [not 2nd order TVD] HCUS [not 2nd order TVD] HQUICK [not 2nd order TVD] Koren – third-order accurate for sufficiently smooth data minmod – symmetric monotonized central (MC) – symmetric Osher ospre – symmetric smart [not 2nd order TVD] superbee – symmetric Sweby – symmetric UMIST – symmetric van Albada 1 – symmetric van Albada 2 – alternative form [not 2nd order TVD] used on high spatial order schemes van Leer – symmetric All the above limiters indicated as being symmetric, exhibit the following symmetry property, This is a desirable property as it ensures that the limiting actions for forward and backward gradients operate in the same way. Unless indicated to the contrary, the above limiter functions are second order TVD. This means that they are designed such that they pass through a certain region of the solution, known as the TVD region, in order to guarantee stability of the scheme. Second-order, TVD limiters satisfy at least the following criteria: , , , , The admissible limiter region for second-order TVD schemes is shown in the Sweby Diagram opposite, and plots showing limiter functions overlaid onto the TVD region are shown below. In this image, plots for the Osher and Sweby limiters have been generated using . Generalised minmod limiter An additional limiter that has an interesting form is the van-Leer's one-parameter family of minmod limiters.

{"text": "Geoffrey John Lawler (born 30 October 1954) is a British public affairs consultant. He was a Conservative Party Member of Parliament, representing Bradford North from 1983 to 1987. Early life Lawler was born in Nairobi, Kenya, where his father Major Ernest Lawler was serving. He went to primary schools in West Germany, and then to Colchester Royal Grammar School and to Richmond School in North Yorkshire. Lawler studied Economics and Accountancy at the University of Hull, where he was President of the Students' Union in 1976-77 (the first Conservative to hold the post). Political activity Already active in Conservative politics, Lawler was an unsuccessful candidate for Humberside County Council in the 1977 elections. On graduating from university he briefly worked for Peat Marwick Mitchell before joining the Yorkshire Area of Conservative Central Office; he worked as a researcher in the Community Affairs department from 1978, moving in 1980 to the Research Department. In 1982, he became a public relations executive with Bulldog Publicity Services in Bradford. In January 1983 he was adopted as Conservative candidate for the Bradford North constituency; after boundary changes it was estimated that Labour had a 16% lead over the Conservatives in the seat. 1983 election The election in Bradford North was one of the more high profile as the local Constituency Labour Party had deselected the sitting MP Ben Ford; Ford then stood as an Independent Labour candidate to try to keep his seat. His replacement as Labour candidate, Pat Wall, was a founder of the Militant tendency, and when Labour Party leader Michael Foot visited to support him, full-page newspaper adverts placed by the Conservative Party reprinted part of a speech in which Wall had declared that a Marxist Labour government, on coming to office \"will face bloodshed. We will face the possibility of civil war and the terrible death and destruction and bloodshed that would mean\". In addition, the SDP candidate Peter Birkby was a well known former Labour agent. At the end of the campaign, Michael Foot was challenged by Robin Day in a televised interview to say whether he would back Pat Wall or Ben Ford. Foot replied \"I'm not going to answer in that way\". When the votes were counted, Lawler was declared elected with a majority of 1,602 over Pat Wall; he had won with only 34.3% of the vote but with the twelfth biggest swing to the Conservatives in Britain. Lawler became the first Conservative to win a Parliamentary seat in Bradford since 1970. He later declared that he had not expected to win. Parliament Lawler made his maiden speech on 22 July in a debate on regional industrial policy; he complained that Yorkshire had suffered from an inequality of treatment, but that the regional assistance in the manner provided since the second world war was inappropriate to contemporary needs. He did not support massive public intervention. After demanding an inquiry into under-employment, in late 1983 he called on the Government to abolish or privatise the Crown Agents. Lawler voted to reintroduce the death penalty for murderers of police or prison officers only, and against its reintroduction generally, in July 1983. In January 1985 he was one of 70 Conservative MPs to break the whip and vote to reject a planning inspectors' report supporting expansion of Stansted Airport. In November 1984, his name was drawn as sixteenth in the annual ballot for twenty MPs to introduce a Private member's bill; he introduced the Fabric Origin Marking Bill which would require the country of origin to be indicated; his Bill made no progress. After the Bradford City stadium fire, he noted that the death toll would have been much worse had there been a fence in front of the stand to stop pitch invasions. He asked for money to be made available to build a new stand as quickly as possible. Lawler spoke strongly in favour of televising the House of Commons in November 1985, arguing that if the public did not like what they saw, then Parliament should look to itself to change. In July 1986 he owned up to leading a plot among backbench MPs to make sure there were enough present at 1 AM to vote to increase the allowances used to pay for secretaries and researchers by 50%. The Government had proposed an increase of only 6% and Mrs Thatcher complained the following day about the increase in the cost of Parliament. As vice-chairman of the Conservative backbench employment committee, he protested against comments by Lord Chief Justice Lord Lane who had called for lower sentences for people found to have committed benefit fraud; Lawler described Lane's comments as \"an affront to all law-abiding people who declare their incomes and pay all their taxes, and equally to those who are honest claimants of social security and depend on it for their income\". Leaving Parliament Due to the circumstances of his 1983 win, Lawler's chances of retaining the seat at any subsequent election were not rated highly; Lawler himself knew that his seat was \"highly risky\". He made strenuous efforts to attract the votes of Asian residents of the constituency, who did not traditionally vote Conservative. Although the Conservative vote in Bradford North increased by more than 3,000, Lawler was defeated in the 1987 election by Pat Wall, who was standing again, by 1,633 votes. He noted that being an MP \"doesn't give you many additional recognisable skills other than being a good communicator\", but since he had previously worked in public relations before his election, he returned to the same field. Lawler subsequently submitted his name for selection in several constituencies for the 1992 general election (among them Finchley, following Margaret Thatcher's announcement of her retirement) but after several narrow defeats was not selected anywhere. In 1991 he set up on his own as managing director of The Public Affairs Company, a political consultancy based in Leeds. A few days after the 2005 general election, Lawler wrote to The Times to remark that the Conservative Party's strategy was \"misconceived\" and that the negative tone \"repelled many people and buried the positive reasons that would attract them to support the Conservatives\"; he appeared to blame Lynton Crosby by calling for no more immigration by \"election experts from Australia\". In 2010 Lawler joined Keene Public Affairs, and was promoted to its board of directors in July 2011.

{"text": "Bruce Faulkner Caputo (born August 7, 1943) is an American lawyer and politician from New York. He is most notable for his service as a member of the New York State Assembly (1973 to 1976) and the United States House of Representatives (1977 to 1979). Early life Caputo was born in New York City on August 7, 1943, the son of Doris (Burke Caputo) and attorney Anthony Caputo. He graduated from Deerfield Academy in 1961, Harvard University (Bachelor of Arts, 1965), and Harvard Business School (Master of Business Administration, 1967). Caputo began his career in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, who at the time was Robert McNamara, where the Systems Analysis Unit hired recent business school graduates to work on policy issues. While working at the Defense Department, Caputo attended law school at night. In 1971, he received his J.D. degree from Georgetown University Law Center. In 1969 Caputo was one of the four co-founders and a board member and principal stockholder of ICF, a management consulting company. Initially focusing on energy and health care issues, the company later expanded into environmental businesses and began to build engineering capabilities. In 1988 ICF acquired Kaiser Engineers, which had originated as the engineering unit of Henry J. Kaiser's industrial empire and grew to rank among the largest engineering and construction companies in the world. The following year (1989) the combined company went public and eventually traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The company operated as \"ICF Kaiser,\" with the consulting unit remaining largely intact. In 1999, ICF Consulting ended its decade-long affiliation with Kaiser Engineers through a leveraged buyout, financed in part by the CM Equity Partners, LP, an equity investment firm based in New York City. In 2006, ICF Consulting was renamed ICF International. The firm completed an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and became a publicly traded firm listed on the NASDAQ exchange as ICFI. Start of career Caputo was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1972, representing a district in Yonkers. He was re-elected in 1974, and sat in the 180th and 181st New York State Legislatures. Caputo served on the Assembly Ways and Means, Housing and Insurance committees. In 1976, Republican Congressman Peter A. Peyser gave up his seat to challenge incumbent U.S. Senator James L. Buckley for the Republican Senate nomination. Caputo ran for the congressional seat and won, defeating Democratic Assemblyman J. Edward Meyer, a former Republican who became a Democrat in 1973. Caputo's district included Yonkers, three towns in lower Westchester and the Woodlawn, Wakefield, Williamsbridge, Edenwald, Eastchester and Baychester sections of the Bronx. Caputo served on the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs committee and the Ethics committee. In 1978, Perry Duryea, the Republican leader of the State Assembly and front runner for the Republican nomination for governor, picked Caputo as his running mate for lieutenant governor. The Republican state convention nominated them in the fall of 1978. Incumbent Governor Hugh L. Carey, a Democrat, and his running mate Mario Cuomo, defeated the Duryea-Caputo ticket in the November general election. Following the 1978 elections Caputo served out his term in Congress and joined the management consulting firm Booz-Allen Hamilton in its mergers and acquisitions and banking departments. U.S. Senate campaigns 1980 U.S. Senate race In 1980, Caputo entered the Republican primary against U.S. Senator Jacob Javits, but withdrew after his main rival on the right, Alfonse D'Amato, secured the nomination of the Conservative party. D'Amato defeated Javits in the Republican primary and won the general election in the fall. In his autobiography, \"Power, Politics, and Pasta: The World According to Senator Al D'Amato\" (1995), D'Amato bitterly criticized Caputo. In 1981, President Reagan nominated Caputo as an alternate United States delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. The Senate confirmed the nomination and Caputo began serving in the spring of that year. 1982 U.S. Senate race Early in 1982, Caputo announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who was seeking a second term. Considered a young rising star in the Republican Party, Caputo raised money around the country but withdrew from the race after failing to get the support of key Republican and Conservative Party county leaders. At the start of his campaign, several news outlets reported that Caputo claimed to have served as a second lieutenant in the United States Army in the 1960s. In fact, he actually served at the Pentagon in a civilian capacity, a detail which was unearthed and provided to reporters by Moynihan staffer Tim Russert. Caputo ultimately withdrew from the race. Later that year, Assemblywoman Florence M. Sullivan of Brooklyn won the Republican primary; she was defeated by Moynihan in the general election. After leaving politics, Caputo worked as a lawyer and private investor in real estate and early stage privately held companies. Personal life Caputo is married to Bonnie Tiburzi Caputo, the first woman pilot for a major airline. They have two children and reside in Manhattan.

{"text": "In anatomy, the orbital septum (palpebral fascia) is a membranous sheet that acts as the anterior (frontal) boundary of the orbit. It extends from the orbital rims to the eyelids. It forms the fibrous portion of the eyelids. Structure In the upper eyelid, the orbital septum blends with the tendon of the levator palpebrae superioris, and in the lower eyelid with the tarsal plate. When the eyes are closed, the whole orbital opening is covered by the septum and tarsi. Medially it is thin, and, becoming separated from the medial palpebral ligament, attaches to the lacrimal bone at its posterior crest. The medial ligament and its much weaker lateral counterpart, attached to the septum and orbit, keep the lids stable as the eye moves. The septum is perforated by the vessels and nerves which pass from the orbital cavity to the face and scalp. Clinical significance Orbital septum supports the orbital contents located posterior to it, especially orbital fat. The septum can be weakened by trauma or due to hereditary diseases. Anatomical structures important in the blepharoplasty operation (operation to strengthen the orbital septum) are located posterior to the orbital septum. The orbital septum is an important structure that separates anterior and posterior extent of the orbit. Orbital septum acts as a physical barrier that prevents the infection of the anterior part of the eye spreading posteriorly. For example, preseptal cellulitis mainly infects the eyelids, anterior to the orbital septum. Meanwhile, orbital cellulitis is located posterior the orbital septum, due to infections spreading from the ethmoidal sinuses. The porous lamina papyracea separating the orbit from the ethmoidal sinus causes infection to spread between the orbit and ethmoidal sinuses. Infection of the ethmoidal sinuses can spread to the brain, causing meningitis and cerebral abscess. Orbital cellulitis can also spread to the anterior orbit, by lifting the loosely attached periosteum, causing subperiosteal abscess. Imaging Orbital septum appears as hypointense on both MRI T1 and T2 weighted images, in contrast with surrounding hyperintense fat.

{"text": "Chinese Mongolians can be subdivided into three groups: Mongolian citizens of ethnic Chinese background, temporary residents with Chinese citizenship, and permanent residents with Chinese citizenship. Mongolia's 1956 census counted ethnic Chinese as 1.9% of the population; the United States government estimated their proportion to be 2% in 1987, or roughly 40,000 people. The 2000 census showed 1,323 permanent residents of Chinese descent; this figure does not include naturalised citizens, temporary residents, nor illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants from China were estimated at 10,000 in the 1990s; some use Mongolia as a transit point into Russia. Second Turkic Khaganate Ethnic Chinese artists were hired by Bilge Khagan of the Second Turkic Khaganate. Chinese text on a silk piece of yellow color was found in a Turkic tomb. Liao dynasty During the Liao dynasty, Han Chinese lived in Kedun, situated in present-day Mongolia. Chinese farmers migrated in. Many Han people migrated to cities located in modern-day Mongolia under Liao rule. Yuan dynasty Ethnic Han officials were sent by the Yuan dynasty to the Lingbei Province (modern-day Mongolia and Siberia; 和宁路 益蘭州 謙州). The Yenisei area had a community of weavers of Han origin, and Samarkand and Outer Mongolia both had artisans of Han origin, as observed by Qiu Chuji. Ming dynasty During the Ming dynasty, ethnic Chinese military frontiersmen in Liaodong were prone to mixing and acculturating with non-Han tribesmen. Ethnic Chinese soldiers served in the Yuan army against the Ming, and the Mongols were joined by many Chinese defectors. The Mongol Mangui served in the Ming military and fought the Manchus, dying in battle against a Manchu raid. Some Chinese people who lived among the Mongols in Inner Mongolia, while in their youth, adopted Mongol culture and married Mongol women. A Han military officer who defected to the Mongols was \"Monkey Li\" (Li Huai) who fought against the Ming dynasty. Qing dynasty Historically, the Gobi served as a barrier to large-scale Han settlement in what was, before 1921, called Outer Mongolia; the unsuitability of most of the territory for agriculture made settlement less attractive. Some Han settlements in Mongolia were founded in 1725, when farmers moved there by decree of the Qing dynasty to cultivate food for soldiers fighting against the Dzungars. They were established in the Orkhon and Tuul river basins, and in 1762, in the Khovd region. After the fighting ended, the Qing closed off Mongolia (then under Qing rule) to immigration and occasionally evicted Han merchants. Despite those restrictions, trade firms owned by Han people continually penetrated Mongolia, concentrating mainly in Ikh Khüree, Uliastai, Khovd and Kyakhta. Their trade practices and the lifestyle of the Mongol nobility lead to an ever-increasing indebtedness of the banners, nobles, and ordinary people, and Han-owned businesses became a target of public discontent as early as Chingünjav's uprising in 1756. The spill-over from the Dungan rebellions of the 1870s into Mongolia also saw a number of Han-owned businesses in Khovd and Uliastai destroyed. Many of the ethnic Han merchants lived in Mongolia only seasonally or until they had made enough money to return to China proper. Others took Mongol wives, at least for the time of being in Mongolia. In 1906, the Qing dynasty began to implement policies aimed at Chinese colonization of Outer Mongolia along the lines of those in Inner Mongolia, but these policies never took full effect as a result of the Xinhai Revolution and the Mongolian declaration of independence from China. The total Han population at that time, mainly consisting of traders and artisans, but also of some colonists, can be estimated to have been at some ten thousand. Since 1911 Upon Mongolia's declaration of independence, many Chinese became victims of atrocities, particularly in Khovd. However, after 1912, Chinese businesses were able to continue their operations, including collection of debts, largely unimpeded. It was only the establishment of communism that meant an end to Chinese trade in Mongolia. Ever-increasing obstacles to commerce were created, and the closure of the border to China for imports in 1928 meant an end for Chinese enterprise in the country. With the People's Republic of China development aid projects of the 1950s, many Han Chinese entered Mongolia, beginning in 1955. By 1961, they had reached a number of 20,000. However, after the Sino-Soviet split in the early 1960s, in which Mongolia sided with the Soviets, China eventually withdrew most of its workers. At the same time, Mongolian politicians or academicians with alleged links to China (e.g. Ts. Lookhuuz or G. Sükhbaatar) became victims of political purges. In the early 1980s, Ulan Bator was reported to have a small Chinese community, which published a Chinese-language newspaper and which looked to the Chinese embassy there for moral support. However, in 1983, Mongolia systematically began expelling some of the remaining 7,000 Chinese contract workers in Mongolia to China. At the same time, ethnic Chinese who had become naturalized citizens were reported to be unaffected. Because the presence and the status of Chinese residents in Mongolia were politically sensitive subjects, Mongolian sources usually avoided mentioning the Chinese at all. After the introduction of democracy, another wave of Chinese immigrants has entered the country. Many of the migrants work in the construction sector, while others run small or medium enterprises. Negative sentiment against Chinese migrants remains; China is seen as a potential threat to Mongolia's security and cultural identity. However, not all recent immigrants from China are ethnic Han Chinese; in particular, there are a number of Inner Mongolians.

{"text": "Claybrooke Magna is a village and civil parish in the Harborough district of Leicestershire, England, close to the A5 trunk road. The village is located between junctions 20 and 21 of the M1, and the towns of Leicester, Rugby, Lutterworth and Market Harborough are easily accessible. History The village's name means 'brook with clayey soil'. Claybrooke Magna with Claybrooke Parva were listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as being within the wapentake of Guthlaxton, which centuries later was referred to as a hundred. The manor was managed by a local lord named Fulco, who was subordinate to the tenant-in-chief, the wise and powerful Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester. According to information sourced from the Vision of Britain in the 1870s, Claybrooke was described as: \"CLAYBROOKE, two townships in Lutterworth district, Leicester; and a parish partly also in Warwick. One of the townships bears the name of Great Claybrooke; lies near the junction of Watling-street and the Fosse way, 1 mile WSW of Ullesthorpe r. station, and 4 NW of Lutterworth; occupies high ground, commanding an extensive view; includes the site of the Roman station Vennonæ; and has a post office, of the name of Claybrooke, under Lutterworth. Pop., 424. Houses, 103. The other township bears the name of Little Claybrooke; and lies contiguous to Great Claybrooke. ...\" The population and wealth of the region grew, leading locally to partition of the ancient parish of Claybrooke into the civil parish of Claybrook Magna and the adjoining civil parish of Claybrooke Parva in the late 1800s. Claybrooke Magna has seven grade II listed buildings. Including the Claybrooke Mill House, Manor Farmhouse, Dairy Farmouse, Claybrooke Mill, Claybrooke Mill House, Ashleigh and the Dairy Farmhouse. The Watermill dates from 1763 and was extended in 1840. It is stated that milling has taken place at the watermill for over 1000 years and most of the mill machinery is still intact and the mill continues to be in commercial operation. In 2014, Miller Sally Craven produces over 40 different varieties of flour at the Watermill. There is a varied product range and includes traditional flour types as well as unusual blends such as Chilli Flour Mix and Spicy Tomato Flour Mix which shows how the mill has diversified since its establishment in 1763. These products are sold and available from local outlets. The Dairy Farmhouse includes an early 17th-century stable which was altered in the late 17th century. It is thought that the stable was originally part of an agricultural complex. It became a listed building on 30 September 1993. Claybrooke Village Hall is a traditional Victorian building located along the main street, which has been modernised in recent years to offer facilities for social and sporting events within the local community. It can accommodate up to 100 people in the main hall and the Meeting Room has space for up to 30. In the 1960s new homes were built in Claybrooke on the site of the original woodyard and listed buildings Claybrooke Mill and Claybrooke Hall were refurbished. Although local amenities diminished resulting in the village shop and post office closing. In 1972 Whitmores Timbers relocated their site in Bury St Edmunds to its current centrally located site within the village of Claybrooke Magna. The remains of the chapel still remain in Claybrooke but serve the purpose of storing machinery from the woodyard. Claybrooke Magna has previously accommodated three pubs within the village, one of these being 'The Blue Bell' which was closed in the 1920s and had an alternate use as a bakehouse after closure. In 1986 it was recorded as being the private house of 'The White House' but according to records has since been demolished. 'The Royal Oak' was situated on the Main Road and was known as The Woodcutter at time of closure. Although, the village is currently home to a local pub called 'The Pig in Muck'. In July 2013, it opened its very own brewery to the general public. Allowing the general public to see how the beer is brewed. It is now brewing the Pig Pub Brewery cask conditioned beers which are all served within the pub and also at a sister pub located in Leicester City Centre. In 1997, TV actor Barry Evans was found dead at his home in Claybrooke Magna. A youth was charged with attempted murder but later released. The exact circumstances surrounding his death remain a mystery. Demographics According to the 2011 Census, Claybrooke Magna had a population of 613. There were also 222 households in the area. The Topographical Dictionary of England was published in 1848 and details the population of Greater Claybrooke as 514 and Little Claybrooke as 104. Historically in Claybrooke Magna, men were employed by the timber mill or worked on the land, but now few men who live within Claybrooke Magna are employed in this sort of primary and secondary employment. The 2001 census found that 26.7% of residents work within the extractive and manufacturing industries, whereas 73.3% work in the service industries. This trend is concordant with the trend within England as it was found that in 2011, less than one in 100 people worked in agriculture in England and Wales. In 2014, there is unemployment among younger members of Claybrooke Magna which could be attributed poor public transport facilities and a large majority of the working population commute to larger towns within the area such as Leicester or Coventry for work.

{"text": "Richmond Hill is a district of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. The district lies a mile to the east of the city centre between York Road (A64 road), East End Park and Cross Green. The appropriate City of Leeds ward is Burmantofts and Richmond Hill. History Richmond Hill developed as a residential and industrial area during the late-18th and 19th centuries. The housing in the area was originally small cottages, but during the industrial revolution many streets of back-to-back terrace houses were built to house the influx of workers. Upper Accommodation Road is the historic heart of the area with some of the more historic buildings on the west side and newer ones on the east. A Leeds Industrial Co-operative building from 1902 is on a corner with East Park Road. In the 20th century much of the housing stock was updated with schemes such as the Saxton Gardens. The Saxton Gardens estate has since been redeveloped by Urban Splash to create 410 homes, allotments and the largest communal garden in the city. Four churches were built in the area. On top of the hill is the Anglican Parish Church of St Saviour, a Grade I listed building built in 1845, founded by Edward Bouverie Pusey. Nearby is the redundant Roman Catholic Mount St Mary's Church (opened 1857, closed 1989). It was built to serve the Irish community which had come to live in the area (then slum housing and industry known as The Bank) by the 1850s, and was considered to be the largest parish church in Europe. Mount St Mary's Catholic High School originates from a convent school to serve the same community. On York Road, All Saints Church, (now closed) was built in 1980 to replace an earlier and larger church of the same name. Newbourne Methodist Church, designed by the architects Charlton and Crowther, Leeds, opened in 1971 and is located on Upper Accommodation Road. The church occupies part of the site of the former Bourne Primitive Methodist Chapel, which was opened in 1878. The former Leeds (Richmond Hill) Circuit of the Methodist Church later became part of the Leeds East Circuit, which merged with Leeds North-East Circuit in September 2013. The circuit's records are now held by the West Yorkshire Archive Service. In May 2012 it was reported that the area has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the United Kingdom, with one in ten girls in the area becoming pregnant by the age of 18. Amenities Richmond Hill has limited amenities. The Electrical Engineering department of the former Leeds College of Technology was at one time based on East Street. There are local shops including off licences, newsagents and fast food takeaways. There is a medical centre and dental practice on East Park Road. Transport Richmond Hill lies close to the Leeds Inner Ring Road, and major routes in and out of the city which provides the area with many bus services. Most bus services are operated by First Leeds. The route 4 bus runs to the city centre, Seacroft, Gipton, Harehills, St James' Hospital, Wortley, Bramley and Pudsey. The 18 runs to Garforth, Colton, Halton the city centre, Headingley, West Park, Ireland Wood and Tinshill. The 37 runs to Halton Moor, Osmondthorpe and the city centre.

{"text": "Bernardo Corradi (; born 30 March 1976) is an Italian former footballer who played as a forward, and current coach. He played top-division football for several teams in Italy, Spain, and England, and last played for Canadian side Montreal Impact of Major League Soccer in 2012. He is also a former Italian international, with 13 caps and two goals from 2003 to 2004. Corradi represented his country at UEFA Euro 2004. He is currently in charge as head of the Italy U17 team. Club career Early career Corradi began his career in Italy with Siena, at that time at Serie C1. He then left for U.S. Poggibonsi of Serie C2. He played there for two seasons, one in Serie C2 and the second in Serie D. In 1996, he left for Serie C2 club A.S.D. Mobilieri Ponsacco Calcio, also located in Tuscany. In mid-1997, he joined Cagliari of Sardinia, and after two matches, he was loaned to Montevarchi in November. In the next season, he was loaned to Andria. In 1999, he returned to Cagliari and played his first Serie A match. Chievo and Inter Milan In 2000, Corradi was jointly signed by Chievo and Inter Milan. Using his height as ability, he started showing his talent as central forward and scored his first Serie A goal at Chievo. He stayed at the club for two seasons, until Inter paid €4 million to purchase him outright. Considered the ideal understudy to Christian Vieri, he played his first and only match for Inter against Sporting Clube de Portugal. After Ronaldo left the club for Real Madrid, Inter signed Lazio's Hernán Crespo, and sent Corradi in the opposite direction as part of the deal, in which Crespo was valued at €38 million and Corradi at €12 million. Lazio later brought down Corradi's value to €5.5 million and the rest deferred to amortize in a 10-year special amortization fund. Lazio At Lazio, Corradi scored on his debut, and formed a strike partnership with Claudio López, while Enrico Chiesa and Simone Inzaghi played as substitutes. He was offered a contract extension in July 2003. In the second season, he was the first choice, and partnered with Roberto Muzzi, Lopez or Inzaghi. Corradi scored ten goals in both his league seasons with the club, and also scored a vital away goal when Lazio beat Juventus to the 2004 Coppa Italia title. Valencia Corradi signed for Valencia in the summer of 2004, along with Lazio teammate Stefano Fiore, in a deal which also repaid unpaid transfer fees (€16.6 million) incurred when Gaizka Mendieta moved from Valencia to Lazio for €42 million, while Corradi was valued at €10 million. Corradi opened his season with the Spanish club by winning the UEFA Supercup. However, once compatriot coach Claudio Ranieri left the club, he found his first team appearances becoming less frequent, as he fell out of form. He was loaned back to Italy, playing for Parma for the 2005–06 season, in which he scored ten times in 36 appearances. Manchester City In the 2006 close season he was sold by Valencia to Manchester City for an undisclosed fee on 20 July, signing a three-year contract with the Premier League club. Corradi made his Manchester City debut in the opening match of the 2006–07 Premier League season against Chelsea, but was sent off after receiving a second yellow card due to his reaction to an incident involving Michael Essien. It took Corradi until his 13th Manchester City appearance before he scored his first goals for the club, when he scored twice against Fulham on 18 November 2006, becoming the first Italian to score for the club. In December Corradi was again sent off for two yellow cards, this time against Manchester United, with the second for attempting to win a penalty by diving. The sending off in the Manchester Derby infuriated Stuart Pearce, who believed it was justified. Corradi lost his starting place to Emile Mpenza, as he only scored three league goals during the 2006–07 season, his other goal coming in a defeat to Portsmouth in February. Corradi looked to be leaving Manchester City after his poor season. When Sven-Göran Eriksson was appointed as their new manager, Corradi was given a chance to impress and took it well by scoring four goals in the pre-season of 2007. However, he did not feature in any of their Premier League or League Cup games and was subsequently loaned out again to Parma for the rest of the season. Corradi impressed during his first couple of appearances for his new club, but again got himself into disciplinary problems, when he was sent off in the first half, during a match with Roma. He finished with a tally of 5 goals in 15 starts, and was given the captain's armband. Reggina and Udinese On 30 July 2008, Manchester City confirmed that Corradi had been released from the final year of his contract, to return to Italy, and play for Reggina. On 31 May 2009, they terminated his contract with them. On 3 July, he was signed for free by Udinese, who played him mainly as a substitute. Montreal Impact Corradi made his Impact debut in a 1–0 pre-season exhibition victory over BK Häcken of Sweden on 3 March 2012. He replaced Justin Mapp to start the second half, and played out the final 45 minutes of the match. On 15 March 2012, the Montreal Impact announced that he had signed for three months with the option to extend. He recorded his first MLS goal on 14 April in the 61st minute against FC Dallas with a penalty kick. Corradi was released by Montreal on 7 December 2012. International career Corradi won a total of 13 caps for Italy between 2003 and 2004, scoring two goals. He was considered as a replacement for Christian Vieri when he was first called up to the national team under Giovanni Trapattoni in February 2003; he debuted on 12 February, scoring the only goal of the match in a 1–0 friendly home win over Portugal. He was later included in their Euro 2004 squad, making one appearance throughout the tournament in his nation's 2–1 win over Bulgaria in their final group match, although Italy were eliminated in the first round on head-to-head record, despite not losing a match, following a three-way five-point tie with Denmark and Sweden. Along with Valencia teammate Marco Di Vaio, he was played up front by new Italy national football team coach Marcello Lippi in the first few matches of qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in late 2004. After the rise of Luca Toni and Alberto Gilardino, while Corradi struggled at Valencia, he did not receive an international call-up again. Style of play Often described as an \"old-fashioned\" centre-forward in the Italian media, Corradi was a tall, powerful, and physically strong striker, with an eye for goal, who excelled in the air; he was also known for his work-rate off the ball, and his ability to press defenders in order to help his team win back possession. During his prime, his playing style drew comparisons with that of Pierluigi Casiraghi. Coaching career In 2017, he joined the Italy national youth team as an assistant to Italy U17 head coach Carmine Nunziata. He subsequently worked as head coach of the Italy U16 and Italy U18, before returning to the Under-17 team in 2020, this time as a head coach. Television career Bernardo Corradi (in couple with the dancer Stefano De Martino) in May–June 2017 is one of the tutors/mentors in the second season of Selfie – Le cose cambiano, a talent show produced by Fascino PGT of Maria De Filippi and aired by Canale 5 with Simona Ventura as presenter. Personal life In June 2014, Corradi married the Italian model Elena Santarelli.

{"text": "A testamentary trust (sometimes referred to as a will trust or trust under will) is a trust which arises upon the death of the testator, and which is specified in their will. A will may contain more than one testamentary trust, and may address all or any portion of the estate. Testamentary trusts are distinguished from inter vivos trusts, which are created during the settlor's lifetime. There are four parties involved in a testamentary trust: the person who specifies that the trust be created, usually as a part of their will, but it may be set up in abeyance during the person's lifetime. This person may be called the grantor or trustor, but is usually referred to as the settlor; the trustee, whose duty is to carry out the terms of the will. they may be named in the will, or may be appointed by the probate court that handles the will; the beneficiary(s), who will receive the benefits of the trust; Although not a party to the trust itself, the probate court is a necessary component of the trust's activity. It oversees the trustee's handling of the trust. A testamentary trust is a legal arrangement created as specified in a person's will, and is occasioned by the death of that person. It is created to address any estate accumulated during that person's lifetime or generated as a result of a postmortem lawsuit, such as a settlement in a survival claim, or the proceeds from a life insurance policy held on the settlor. A trust can be created to oversee such assets. A trustee is appointed to direct the trust until a set time when the trust expires, such as when minor beneficiaries reach a specified age or accomplish a deed such as completing a set educational goal or achieving a specified matrimonial status. For a testamentary trust, as the settlor is deceased, they will generally not have any influence over the trustee's exercise of discretion, although in some jurisdictions it is common for the testator to leave a letter of wishes for the trustee. In practical terms testamentary trusts tend to be driven more by the needs of the beneficiaries (particularly infant beneficiaries) than by tax considerations, which are the usual considerations in inter vivos trusts. If a testamentary trust fails, the property usually will be held on resulting trusts for the testator's residuary estate. Some famous English trust law cases were on behalf of the residuary legatees under a will seeking to have testamentary trusts declared void so as to inherit the trust property. An infamous example is Re Diplock [1951] Ch 253, which resulted in the suicide of one of the trustees who was personally liable to account for trust funds that had been disbursed for what he thought were perfectly valid charitable trusts. Advantages of a testamentary trust A testamentary trust provides a way for assets devolving to minor children to be protected until the children are capable of fending for themselves; A testamentary trust has low upfront costs, usually only the cost of preparing the will in such a way as to address the trust, and the fees involved in dealing with the judicial system during probate. Disadvantages of a testamentary trust The trustee is required to meet with the probate court regularly (at least annually in many jurisdictions) and prove that the trust is being handled in a responsible manner and in strict accordance with provisions of the will which created the trust. This may involve considerable legal fees, especially if the trust endures for several years or involves a sophisticated financial or investment structure, and always involves the fees imposed by the judicial system. Such fees and expenses are deducted from the principal of the estate; The trustee must be prepared to oversee the trust for its duration, which involves a considerable commitment in time, possible emotional attachment, and legal liability; A candidate for trustee may be named in the will, but that person has no legal obligation to accept the appointment. If no trustee is named in the will (or is unavailable, even if named), the probate court will appoint a trustee; It can be difficult for beneficiaries to bring a dishonest trustee to account. They may sue at law, or the malfeasance may be pointed out at the annual probate court review, but such remedies are slow, time-consuming and expensive, and are not guaranteed to succeed. Summary Due to the potential problems, lawyers often advise that a revocable living trust or inter vivos trust be created instead of a testamentary trust. However, a testamentary trust may be a better solution if the expected estate is small compared to potential life-insurance settlement amounts.

{"text": "General Mohamed Mediène (), also known as Toufik (توفيق), is an Algerian intelligence officer who formerly served as head of the country's secret services, the Intelligence and Security Department (Département du renseignement et de la sécurité, DRS), from 1990 to 2015. He was described as the world's longest serving \"intelligence chief\" and nicknamed le chakal. He was born in 1939 to a family from Guenzet (Sétif Province), but grew up near Algiers at Saint-Eugene (Bologhine). He joined the National Liberation Army in 1961, a few months before Algeria's independence. He was an officer for the NLA. Career Post-independence Shortly after independence, he joined other NLA military members in studying at a KGB school in the Soviet Union. He was then posted to the 2nd military region (around Oran, bordering Morocco), then commanded by future President Chadli Bendjedid, where he established ties with Larbi Belkheir. In 1983, he was posted to Tripoli as military attaché. Soon after returning, he became head of presidential security for Bendjedid. He later became head of army security in the Sécurité Militaire, led at the time by Mohamed Betchine. After Betchine's departure in 1987, Mediene was appointed general and a temporary chief of the intelligence organization. Soon after taking charge, he oversaw a reorganization of the Sécurité Militaire, and renamed it the Département du renseignement et de la sécurité (DRS). After the 1991 election At the time of the 1991 legislative election, which was won by the Islamic Salvation Front, Mediene joined a group of ruling generals in Les éradicateurs (\"the Eradicator\") faction. This name derives from the goal of eradicating the Islamists, as opposed to negotiating with them. This group is regarded as behind the military coup that followed the election's first round. The Eradicator faction is regarded to have gained and held power during the civil war triggered by the military coup. Since the 1992 coup, a \"shadowy\" group of generals and intelligence officers known to the Algerians collectively as le pouvoir (“the power”) and whose individual members are called décideurs has dominated Algerian politics with the FLN reduced down to a mere front for le pouvoir. Little is known for certain about le pouvoir, but Mediene has frequently been mentioned as a leading décideur. Officially, the languages of Algeria are Arabic and Berber, but in practice, most Algerians speak a language called Darija that is a mixture of Arabic, Berber and French, which explains why French expressions are often used in Algeria. Arabic has been the official language of Algeria since 1962, but French remains the language of power in Algeria and cabinet meetings are conducted in French, the language of the Algerian elite, who often struggle with Arabic. During the civil war, the DRS, led by Mediene, headed efforts to repress Islamist groups. DRS agents, which reportedly number as high as 100,000, infiltrated and manipulated terrorist groups, and stopped efforts in both ruling and opposition groups to negotiate with the ISF. In 1993, he was promoted to general-major, and in July 2006, he was promoted to Lieutenant General (Général de corps d'armée.) Although he supported President Abdelaziz Bouteflika as part of the Eradicator faction, Mediene through the DRS was later believed to be involved in a power struggle with Bouteflika. After supporting Bouteflika's first three terms, he did not support his fourth term bid, announced in January 2014. Preceding this, Ahmed Gaid Salah, the Deputy Minister of Defense, accused the DRS of complacency in failing to prevent the In Amenas hostage crisis. And in September 2013, the DRS was reorganised to bring more of it under state control. In February 2014, the secretary general of Bouteflika's party, the FLN, accused the DRS of infiltrating and destabilizing several political parties. Through the DRS' networks, Mediène was believed to hold significant power in Algeria's media, business lobbies, army, and different political parties. The Economist wrote in 2012 that \"The most powerful man in the land may be Mohamed Mediène, known as Toufiq...\". In 2013 The Economist reported: \"Despite his leading role in defeating Islamic militants in a brutal civil war between 1991 and 2000, and his less public role as kingmaker in the pouvoir, General Mediene’s face remains unknown; it is said that anyone who has seen it expires soon after.\" A popular rumor in Algeria that cannot be verified has it that Mediène \"always receives people in his office with his back turned - if you see his face, this is the last time you see someone in your life.\" Regardless if this rumor is true or not, the popularity of this rumor says much about Mediène's reputation in Algeria, a man widely viewed as the \"Darth Vader\" of Algerian politics. A popular game in Algeria is attempting to identify Mediène by examining photographs from the 1980s and 1990s of official functions to see if he can be found. On 13 September 2015, it was announced that Mediène was retiring and President Bouteflika had appointed Athmane Tartag to succeed him. Mediène's dismissal was viewed as the culmination of a long \"behind-the-scenes power struggle\" with Bouteflika, leaving the latter fully in charge and giving him more power to determine his own successor.

{"text": "The Mandailing is an ethnic group in Sumatera, Indonesia that is commonly associated with the Batak people. They are found mainly in the northern section of the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. They came under the influence of the Kaum Padri who ruled the Minangkabau of Tanah Datar. As a result, the Mandailing were influenced by Muslim culture and converted to Islam. There are also a group of Mandailing in Malaysia, especially in the states of Selangor and Perak. They are closely related to the Angkola and Toba. Etymology The etymology of 'Mandailing' is said to be a compounding of the words mande, meaning 'mother', and hilang, meaning 'lost'. Thus, the name is said to mean \"lost mother\". The Mandailing society is patriarchal, employing family names, or marga. The well known margas in Mandailing clan are:Lubis, Nasution, Siregar, Ritonga, Hasibuan, Harahap, Dalimunthe (originally from Munthe), Matondang, Rangkuti, Parinduri, Puasa, Pulungan, Rambe, Daulae(y), Pohan, Batubara (not to be confused with the Batu Bara people from the east coast of Sumatra), Barus and Hutajulu. History According to Tamboen's account (1952) the Mandailing, along with other sub-ethnic Batak groups are the descendants of one man by the name of Batak; who migrated to the south before the coming of the Portuguese and Dutch colonisation of Sumatra. Moreover, many Mandailing people are Minangkabau descent from Pagaruyung in Minangkabau highlands, such as Nasution clan. Dutch colonization in Sumatra caused the Mandailing to be included as a sub-category of the Batak, as part of a 'wedge policy' to create a non-Muslim buffer state called Batakland between the powerful Muslim Achehnese and Minangkabau nations. The Mandailing were associated with the Toba Batak people instead of being recognized as a distinct ethnic minority. Consequently, the Mandailing people have been torn between two cultural and ethnic identities, namely Batak-Mandailing in Indonesia and Malay-Mandailing in Malaysia. The Padri War The Padri War, which took place in West Sumatra and spread to the inland parts of East Sumatra between 1803 and 1845, caused an exodus of large groups of Mandailing from their homeland to peninsular Malaya. Among them were groups led by Raja Asal, the overlord of the Mandailings, and his nephew Raja Bilah. Together with Sutan Puasa, they were embroiled in the Klang War from 1866 to 1873, also known as the Selangor War. Raja Asal and Raja Bilah fled to Perak, where their followers settled in Lower Perk and the Kinta Valley. The British appointed Raja Bilah penghulu of Blanja while his son Raja Yacob became penghulu of Tronoh, which generated large revenues after the opening of the Tronoh Mines, the largest tin producer in the world in the 1920s. Region Mandailing is the name of region Luat Mandailing, which is now almost in Mandailing Natal Regency in North Sumatra. The first group who came to this region were the Lubis and Nasution, later followed by the Siregar, Harahap and so forth. Nasution and Lubis are the biggest groups in Mandailing clan. While other groups, such as Pulungan, Harahap, Matondang, Rangkuti, and others are the smaller groups of Luat Mandailing. Harahap and Siregar dwell almost in Luat Angkola, which now belongs to South Tapanuli Regency, situated between Regency and North Tapanuli Regency. Religion The Mandailing people are almost entirely Muslims. Opinion varies in when Islam first arrived in the region, where the 19th century, 18th century or even earlier have been suggested. In the 19th century, a portion of the Mandailing were converted to Islam during the Padri War when Muslim clerics from west Sumatra pressured them to adopt the religion. After conversion, Islam took firm roots in the Mandailing people through integration with the larger Muslim Malay world. The Mandailing people were able to retain many of their native religious practices and adopted a indigenized form of Islam until the modern era, especially in Malaysia where they were forced to conform to state-sponsored Islam.</ref> Migrations The Mandailing people are also known as the great travellers as more and more of the Mandailings are migrating to the various regions in the country as well as around the world. Many of the Mandailings are playing the important roles of the nation. The Indonesian government considered the Mandailings as one of the main tribes in the country. Many Mandailings keep detailed family tree records as it has become the family tradition. It is reported that 98% of the Mandailing ethnic group are Muslim. There are approximately more than one hundred thousand Mandailings In Malaysia nowadays. Many of the Mandailings in Malaysia are visiting their ancestors in Mandailing Regency in Indonesia as it has been a tradition to keep the brotherhood and strong bond of unity among the Mandailings. The Mandailing language is still used by the descendants of Mandailing immigrants in Malaysia, although language shift to Malay is observed among the younger generation. Culture The Mandailing classic of daun ubi tumbuk or mashed tapioca leaves, lush with bunga kantan, lemongrass and coconut milk flavor is a famous food among the Mandailing people. They have a traditional ensemble of drums called Gordang Sambilan. Controversy Majority of the population consider themselves as part of Batak as Ethnolinguistic group The Mandailing people has blood ties, kinship, language, writing script, social systems, arts, customs and norms that are different from the Toba Batak and Angkola Batak.

{"text": "The Decadent movement (Fr. décadence, \"decay\") was a late-19th-century artistic and literary movement, centered in Western Europe, that followed an aesthetic ideology of excess and artificiality. The Decadent movement first flourished in France and then spread throughout Europe and to the United States. The movement was characterized by a belief in the superiority of human fantasy and aesthetic hedonism over logic and the natural world. Overview The concept of decadence dates to the 18th century, especially from the writings of Montesquieu, the Enlightenment philosopher who suggested that the decline (décadence) of the Roman Empire was in large part due to its moral decay and loss of cultural standards. When Latin scholar Désiré Nisard turned toward French literature, he compared Victor Hugo and Romanticism in general to the Roman decadence, men sacrificing their craft and their cultural values for the sake of pleasure. The trends that he identified, such as an interest in description, a lack of adherence to the conventional rules of literature and art, and a love for extravagant language were the seeds of the Decadent movement. French Decadent movement The first major development in French decadence appeared when writers Théophile Gautier and Charles Baudelaire used the word proudly to represent a rejection of what they considered banal \"progress\". Baudelaire referred to himself as decadent in his 1857 edition of Les Fleurs du mal and exalted the Roman decline as a model for modern poets to express their passion. He later used the term decadence to include the subversion of traditional categories in pursuit of full, sensual expression. In his lengthy introduction to Baudelaire in the front of the 1868 Les Fleurs du mal, Gautier at first rejects the application of the term decadent, as meant by the critic, but then works his way to an admission of decadence on Baudelaire's own terms: a preference for what is beautiful and what is exotic, an ease with surrendering to fantasy, and a maturity of skill with manipulating language. The Belgian Félicien Rops was instrumental in the development of this early stage of the Decadent movement. A friend of Baudelaire, he was a frequent illustrator of Baudelaire's writing, at the request of the author himself. Rops delighted in breaking artistic convention and shocking the public with gruesome, fantastical horror. He was explicitly interested in the Satanic, and he frequently sought to portray the double-threat of Satan and Woman. At times, his only goal was the portrayal of a woman he'd observed debasing herself in the pursuit of her own pleasure. It has been suggested that, no matter how horrific and perverse his images could be, Rops' invocation of supernatural elements was sufficient to keep Baudelaire situated in a spiritually aware universe that maintained a cynical kind of hope, even if the poetry \"requires a strong stomach\". Their work was the worship of beauty disguised as the worship of evil. For both of them, mortality and all manner of corruptions were always on their mind. The ability of Rops to see and portray the same world as they did made him a popular illustrator for other decadent authors. The concept of decadence lingered after that, but it was not until 1884 that Maurice Barrès referred to a particular group of writers as Decadents. He defined this group as those who had been influenced heavily by Baudelaire, though they were also influenced by Gothic novels and the poetry and fiction of Edgar Allan Poe. Many were associated with Symbolism, others with Aestheticism. The pursuit of these authors, according to Arthur Symons, was \"a desperate endeavor to give sensation, to flash the impression of the moment, to preserve the very heat and motion of life\", and their achievement, as he saw it, was \"to be a disembodied voice, and yet the voice of a human soul\". In his 1884 decadent novel À rebours (English: Against Nature or Against the Grain), Joris-Karl Huysmans identified likely candidates for the core of the Decadent movement, which he seemed to view Baudelaire as sitting above: Paul Verlaine, Tristan Corbière, Theodore Hannon and Stéphane Mallarmé. His character Des Esseintes hailed these writers for their creativity and their craftsmanship, suggesting that they filled him with \"insidious delight\" as they used a \"secret language\" to explore \"twisted and precious ideas\". Not only did À rebours define an ideology and a literature, but it also created an influential perspective on visual art. The character of Des Esseintes explicitly heralded the paintings of Gustave Moreau, the 17th-century Dutch engraver Jan Luyken's illustrations to the Martyrs Mirror and the lithographs of Rodolphe Bresdin and Odilon Redon. The choice of these works established a decadent perspective on art which favored madness and irrationality, graphic violence, frank pessimism about cultural institutions, and a disregard for visual logic of the natural world. It has been suggested that a dream vision that Des Esseintes describes is based on the series of satanic encounters painted by Félicien Rops. Capitalizing on the momentum of Huysmans' work, Anatole Baju founded the magazine Le Décadent in 1886, an effort to define and organize the Decadent movement in a formal way. This group of writers did not only look to escape the boredom of the banal, but they sought to shock, scandalize, and subvert the expectations and values of society, believing that such freedom and creative experimentation would improve humanity. Not everyone was comfortable with Baju and Le Décadent, even including some who had been published in its pages. Rival writer Jean Moréas published his Symbolist Manifesto, largely to escape association with the Decadent movement, despite their shared heritage. Moréas and Gustave Kahn, among others, formed rival publications to reinforce the distinction. Paul Verlaine embraced the label at first, applauding it as a brilliant marketing choice by Baju. After seeing his own words exploited and tiring of Le Décadent publishing works falsely attributed to Arthur Rimbaud, however, Verlaine came to sour on Baju personally, and he eventually rejected the label, as well. Decadence continued on in France, but it was limited largely to Anatole Baju and his followers, who refined their focus even further on perverse sexuality, material extravagance, and up-ending social expectations. Far-fetched plots were acceptable if they helped generate the desired moments of salacious experience or glorification of the morbid and grotesque. Writers who embraced the sort of decadence featured in Le Décadent include Albert Aurier, Rachilde, Pierre Vareilles, Miguel Hernández, Jean Lorrain and Laurent Tailhade. Many of these authors did also publish symbolist works, however, and it unclear how strongly they would have identified with Baju as decadents. In France, the Decadent movement is often said to have begun with either Joris-Karl Huysmans' Against Nature (1884) or Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal. This movement essentially gave way to Symbolism when Le Décadent closed down in 1889 and Anatole Baju turned toward politics and became associated with anarchy. A few writers continued the decadent tradition, such as Octave Mirbeau, but Decadence was no longer a recognized movement, let alone a force in literature or art. Beginning with the association of decadence with cultural decline, it is not uncommon to associate decadence in general with transitional times and their associated moods of pessimism and uncertainty. In France, the heart of the Decadent movement was during the 1880s and 1890s, the time of fin de siècle, or end-of-the-century gloom. As part of that overall transition, many scholars of Decadence, such as David Weir, regard Decadence as a dynamic transition between Romanticism and Modernism, especially considering the decadent tendency to dehumanize and distort in the name of pleasure and fantasy. Distinction from Symbolism Symbolism has often been confused with the Decadent movement. Arthur Symons, a British poet and literary critic contemporary with the movement, at one time considered Decadence in literature to be a parent category that included both Symbolism and Impressionism, as rebellions against realism. He defined this common, decadent thread as \"an intense self-consciousness, a restless curiosity in research, an over-subtilizing refinement upon refinement, a spiritual and moral perversity\". He referred to all such literature as \"a new and beautiful and interesting disease\". Later, however, he described the Decadent movement as an \"interlude, half a mock interlude\" that distracted critics from seeing and appreciating the larger and more important trend, which was the development of Symbolism. It is true that the two groups share an ideological descent from Baudelaire and for a time they both considered themselves as part of one sphere of new, anti-establishment literature. They worked together and met together for quite a while, as if they were part of the same movement. Maurice Barrès referred to this group as decadents, but he also referred to one of them (Stéphane Mallarmé) as a symbolist. Even Jean Moréas used both terms for his own group of writers as late as 1885. Only a year later, however, Jean Moréas wrote his Symbolist Manifesto to assert a difference between the symbolists with whom he allied himself and this the new group of decadents associated with Anatole Baju and Le Décadent. Even after this, there was sufficient common ground of interest, method, and language to blur the lines more than the manifesto might have suggested. In the world of visual arts, it can be even more difficult to distinguish decadence from symbolism. In fact, Stephen Romer has referred to Félicien Rops, Gustave Moreau, and Fernand Khnopff as \"Symbolist-Decadent painters and engravers\". Nevertheless, there are clear ideological differences between those who continued on as symbolists and those who have been called \"dissidents\" for remaining in the Decadent movement. Often, there was little doubt that Baju and his group were producing work that was decadent, but there is frequently more question about the work of the symbolists. In a website associated with Dr. Petra Dierkes-Thrun's Stanford University course, Oscar Wilde and the French Decadents (2014), a student named Reed created a blog post that is the basis for much of what follows. On nature Both groups reject the primacy of nature, but what that means for them is very different. Symbolism uses extensive natural imagery as a means to elevate the viewer to a plane higher than the banal reality of nature itself, as when Stéphane Mallarmé mixes descriptions of flowers and heavenly imagery to create a transcendent moment in \"Flowers\". Decadence, in contrast, actually belittles nature in the name of artistry. In Huysmans’ Against Nature, for instance, the main character Des Esseintes says of nature: \"There is not one of her inventions, no matter how subtle or imposing it may be, which human genius cannot create ... There can be no doubt about it: this eternal, driveling, old woman is no longer admired by true artists, and the moment has come to replace her by artifice.\" On language and imagery Symbolism treats language and imagery as devices that can only approximate meaning and merely evoke complex emotions and call the mind toward ideas it might not be able to comprehend. In the words of symbolist poet Stéphane Mallarmé:Languages are imperfect because multiple; the supreme language is missing...no one can utter words which would bear the miraculous stamp of Truth Herself Incarnate...how impossible it is for language to express things...in the Poet's hands...by the consistent virtue and necessity of an art which lives on fiction, it achieves its full efficacy.Moréas asserted in his manifesto on symbolism that words and images serve to dress the incomprehensible in such a way that it can be approached, if not understood. Decadence, on the other hand, sees no path to higher truth in words and images. Instead, books, poetry, and art itself as the creators of valid new worlds, thus the allegory of decadent Wilde's Dorian Gray being poisoned by a book like a drug. Words and artifice are the vehicles for human creativity, and Huysmans suggests that the illusions of fantasy have their own reality: \"The secret lies in knowing how to proceed, how to concentrate deeply enough to produce the hallucination and succeed in substituting the dream reality for the reality itself.\" On reality, illusion, and truth Both groups are disillusioned with the meaning and truth offered by the natural world, rational thought, and ordinary society. Symbolism turns its eyes toward Greater Purpose or on the Ideal, using dreams and symbols to approach these esoteric primal truths. In Mallarme's poem \"Apparition\", for instance, the word \"dreaming\" appears twice, followed by \"Dream\" itself with a capital D. In \"The Windows\", he speaks of this decadent disgust of contentment with comfort and an endless desire for the exotic. He writes: \"So filled with disgust for the man whose soul is callous, sprawled in comforts where his hungering is fed.\" In this continuing search for the spiritual, therefore, Symbolism has been predisposed to concern itself with purity and beauty and such mysterious imagery as those of fairies. In contrast, Decadence states there is no oblique approach to ultimate truth because there is no secret, mystical truth. They despise the very idea of searching for such a thing. If there is truth of value, it is purely in the sensual experience of the moment. The heroes of Decadent novels, for instance, have the unquenchable accumulation of luxuries and pleasure, often exotic, as their goal, even the gory and the shocking. In The Temptation of Saint Anthony, decadent Gustave Flaubert describes Saint Anthony's pleasure from watching disturbing scenes of horror. Later Czech decadent Arthur Breisky has been quoted by scholars as speaking to both the importance of illusion and of beauty: \"But isn't it necessary to believe a beautiful mask more than reality?\" On art Ultimately, the distinction may best be seen in their approach to art. Symbolism is an accumulation of \"symbols\" that are there not to present their content but to evoke greater ideas that their symbolism cannot expressly utter. According to Moréas, it is an attempt to connect the objects and phenomena of the world to \"esoteric primordial truths\" that cannot ever be directly approached. Decadence, on the other hand, is an accumulation of signs or descriptions acting as detailed catalogs of human material riches as well as artifice. It was Oscar Wilde who perhaps laid this out most clearly in The Decay of Lying with the suggestion of three doctrines on art, here excerpted into a list: \"Art never expresses anything but itself.\" \"All bad art comes from returning to Life and Nature, and elevating them into ideals.\" \"Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life\" After which, he suggested a conclusion quite in contrast to Moréas' search for shadow truth: \"Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of Art.\" Influence and legacy Collapse of the Decadent movement In France, the Decadent movement could not withstand the loss of its leading figures. Many of those associated with the Decadent movement became symbolists after initially associating freely with decadents. Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé were among those, though both had been associated with Baju's Le Décadent for a time. Others kept a foot in each camp. Albert Aurier wrote decadent pieces for Le Décadent and also wrote symbolist poetry and art criticism. Decadent writer Rachilde was staunchly opposed to a symbolist take over of Le Décadent even though her own one-act drama The Crystal Spider is almost certainly a symbolist work. Others, once strong voices for decadence, abandoned the movement altogether. Joris-Karl Huysmans grew to consider Against Nature as the starting point on his journey into Roman Catholic symbolist work and the acceptance of hope. Anatole Baju, once the self-appointed school-master of French decadence, came to think of the movement as naive and half-hearted, willing to tinker and play with social realities, but not to utterly destroy them. He left decadence for anarchy. The Decadent movement beyond France While the Decadent movement, per se, was mostly a French phenomenon, the impact was felt more broadly. Typically, the influence was felt as an interest in pleasure, an interest in experimental sexuality, and a fascination with the bizarre, all packaged with a somewhat trangressive spirit and an aesthetic that values material excess. Many were also influenced by the Decadent movement's aesthetic emphasis on art for its own sake. Bohemia Czech writers who were exposed to the work of the Decadent movement saw in it the promise of a life they could never know. These Bohemian decadent writers included Karel Hlaváček, Arnošt Procházka, Jiří Karásek ze Lvovic, and Louisa Zikova. One Czech writer, Arthur Breisky, embraced the full spirit of Le Décadent with its exultation in material excess and a life of refinement and pleasure. From the Decadent movement he learned the basic idea of a dandy, and his work is almost entirely focused on developing a philosophy in which the Dandy is the consummate human, surrounded by riches and elegance, theoretically above society, just as doomed to death and despair as they. Britain Influenced through general exposure but also direct contact, the leading decadent figures in Britain associated with decadence were Irish writer Oscar Wilde, poet Algernon Charles Swinburne, and illustrator Aubrey Beardsley, as well as other artists and writers associated with The Yellow Book. Others, such as Walter Pater, resisted association with the movement, even though their works seemed to reflect similar ideals. While most of the influence was from figures such as Baudelaire and Verlaine, there was also very strong influence at times from more purely decadent members of the French movement, such as the influence that Huysmans and Rachilde had on Wilde, as seen explicitly in The Picture of Dorian Gray. British decadents embraced the idea of creating art for its own sake, pursuing all possible desires, and seeking material excess. At the same time, they were not shy about using the tools of decadence for social and political purpose. Beardsley had an explicit interest in the improvement of the social order and the role of art-as-experience in inspiring that transformation. Oscar Wilde published an entire work exploring socialism as a liberating force: \"Socialism would relieve us from that sordid necessity of living for others which, in the present condition of things, presses so hardly upon almost everybody.\" Swinburne explicitly addressed Irish-English politics in poetry when he wrote \"Thieves and murderers, hands yet red with blood and tongues yet black with lies | Clap and clamour – 'Parnell spurs his Gladstone well! In many of their personal lives, they also pursued decadent ideals. Wilde had a secret homosexual life. Swinburne had an obsession with flagellation. Italy Italian literary criticism has often looked at the decadent movement on a larger scale, proposing that its main features could be used to define a full historical period, running from the 1860s to the 1920s. For this reason, the term Decadentism, modelled on \"Romanticism\" or \"Expressionism\", became more substantial and widespread than elsewhere. However, most critics today prefer to distinguish between three periods. The first period is marked by the experience of Scapigliatura, a sort of proto-decadent movement. The Scapigliati (literally meaning \"unkempt\" or \"dishevelled\") were a group of writers and poets who shared a sentiment of intolerance for the suffocating intellectual atmosphere between the late Risorgimento (1860s) and the early years of unified Italy (1870s). They contributed to rejuvenate Italian culture through foreign influences and introduced decadent themes like illness and fascination with death. The novel Fosca (1869) by Igino Ugo Tarchetti tells of a love triangle involving a codependent man, a married woman and an ugly, sick and vampire-like figure, the femme fatale Fosca. In a similar way, Camillo Boito's Senso and his short stories venture into tales of sexual decadence and disturbing obsessions, such as incest and necrophilia. Other Scapigliati were the novelists Carlo Dossi and Giuseppe Rovani, the poet Emilio Praga, the poet and composer Arrigo Boito and the composer Franco Faccio. As for the visual arts, Medardo Rosso stands out as one of the most influential European sculptors of that time. Most of the Scapigliati died of illness, alcoholism or suicide. The second period of Italian Decadentism is dominated by Gabriele D'Annunzio, Antonio Fogazzaro and Giovanni Pascoli. D'Annunzio, who was in contact with many French intellectuals and had read the works of Nietzsche in the French translation, imported the concepts of Übermensch and will to power into Italy, although in his own particular version. The poet's aim had to be an extreme aestheticization of life, and life the ultimate work of art. Recurrent themes in his literary works include the supremacy of the individual, the cult of beauty, exaggerated sophistication, the glorification of machines, the fusion of man with nature, the exalted vitality coexisting with the triumph of death. His novel The Pleasure, published one year before The Picture of Dorian Gray, is considered one of the three genre-defining books of the Decadent movement, along with Wilde's novel and Huysmans's Against Nature. Less flashy and more isolated than D'Annunzio, and close to the French symbolists, Pascoli redefined poetry as a means of clairvoyance to regain the purity of things. Finally, the third period, which can be seen as a postlude to Decadentism, is marked by the voices of Italo Svevo, Luigi Pirandello and the Crepusculars. Svevo, with his novel Zeno's Conscience, took the idea of sickness to its logical conclusion, while Pirandello proceeded to the extreme disintegration of the self with works such as The Late Mattia Pascal, Six Characters in Search of an Author and One, No One, and One Hundred Thousand. On the other side, the Crepuscular poets (literally \"twilight poets\") turned Pascoli's innovations into a mood-conveying poetry, which describes the melancholy of everyday life in shady and monotonous interiors of provincial towns. These atmospheres were explored by the painters Mario Sironi, Giorgio de Chirico and Giorgio Morandi. Guido Gozzano was the most brilliant and ironic of the Crepusculars, but we can also remember Sergio Corazzini, Marino Moretti and Aldo Palazzeschi. Russia The Decadent movement reached into Russia primarily through exposure to the writings of Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine. The earliest Russian adherents lacked idealism and focused on such decadent themes as subversion of morality, disregard for personal health, and living in blasphemy and sensual pleasure. Russian writers were especially drawn to the morbid aspects of decadence and in the fascination with death. Dmitry Merezhkovsky is thought to be the first to clearly promote a Russian decadence that included the idealism that eventually inspired the French symbolists to disassociate from the more purely materialistic Decadent movement. The first Russian writers to achieve success as followers of this Decadent movement included Konstanin Balmont, Fyodor Sologub, Valery Bryusov, and Zinaida Gippius. As they refined their craft beyond imitation of Baudelaire and Verlaine, most of these authors became much more clearly aligned with symbolism than with decadence. Some visual artists adhered to the Baju-esque late Decadent movement approach to sexuality as purely an act of pleasure, often ensconced in a context of material luxury. They also shared the same emphasis on shocking society, purely for the scandal. Among them were Konstantin Somov, , and Nikolay Feofilaktov. Spain Some art historians consider Francisco de Goya one of the roots of the Decadent movement in Spain, almost 100 years before its start in France. His works were a cry of denouncement against injustice and oppression. However, Ramón Casas and José María López Mezquita can be considered the model artists of this period. Their paintings are an image of the social conflicts and police repression that was happening in Spain at the time. Spanish writers also wanted to be part of this movement. Emilia Pardo Bazán with works like Los Pazos de Ulloa where terror and decadent topics appear. El monstruo (The Monster), written by Antonio de Hoyos y Vinent belongs to Decadent movement. But the Decadent movement is overlapped by the Fin de Siglo Movement with the authors of the Generación del 98 being part-decadent: Ramón María del Valle-Inclán, Unamuno and Pío Baroja are the most essential figures of this period. United States Few prominent writers or artists in the United States were connected with the Decadent movement. Those who were connected struggled to find an audience, for Americans were reluctant to see value for them in what they considered the art forms of fin de siècle France. An exception to this is the decadent poet George Sylvester Viereck, who wrote (1907) \"Nineveh and Other Poems\". Viereck states in his \"The Candle and the Flame\" (1912) Poet Francis Saltus Saltus was inspired by Charles Baudelaire, and his unpracticed style occasionally was compared to the French poet's more refined experimentation. He embraced the most debauched lifestyle of the French decadents and celebrated that life in his own poetry. At the time, mostly before Baju's Le Décadent, this frivolous poetry on themes of alcohol and depravity found little success and no known support from those who were part of the Decadent movement. The younger brother of Francis, writer Edgar Saltus had more success. He had some interaction with Oscar Wilde, and he valued decadence in his personal life. For a time, his work exemplified both the ideals and style of the movement, but a significant portion of his career was in traditional journalism and fiction that praised virtue. At the time when he was flourishing, however, multiple contemporary critics, as well as other decadent writers, explicitly considered him one of them. Writer James Huneker was exposed to the Decadent movement in France and tried to bring it with him to New York. He has been lauded to his dedication to this cause throughout his career, but it has been suggested that, while he lived as a decadent and heralded their work, his own work was more frustrated, hopeless, and empty of the pleasure that had attracted him to the movement in the first place. Largely, he focused on cynically describing the impossibility of a true American decadence. Critical studies German doctor and social critic Max Nordau wrote a lengthy book titled Degeneration (1892). It was an examination of decadence as a trend, and specifically attacked several people associated with the Decadent movement, as well as other figures throughout the world who deviated from cultural, moral, or political norms. His language was colorful and vitriolic, often invoking the worship of Satan. What made the book a success was its suggestion of a medical diagnosis of \"degeneration\", a neuro-pathology that resulted in these behaviors. It also helped that the book named such figures as Oscar Wilde, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Paul Verlaine, and Maurice Barrès, members of the Decadent movement who were in the public eye. In 1930, Italian art and literature critic Mario Praz completed a broad study of morbid and erotic literature, translated and published in English as The Romantic Agony (1933). The study included decadent writing (such as Baudelaire and Swinburne), but also anything else that he considered dark, grim, or sexual in some way. His study centered on the 18th and 19th Centuries. The danger of such literature, he believed, is that it unnaturally elevated the instinctive bond between pain and pleasure and that, no matter the artists' intention, the essential role of art is to educate and teach culture.

{"text": "The Liberal Jewish Synagogue, or LJS (, Qahal Kadosh Lev Chadash, \"Holy Congregation New Heart\"), is a house of prayer in St John's Wood, London, founded in 1911. It is the oldest and largest member of Britain's Liberal Judaism, a constituent member of the World Union for Progressive Judaism. The synagogue uses the Lev Chadash denominational prayerbook. Since its earliest days, it has had mixed-gender seating. History Claude Montefiore's Jewish Religious Union, established in 1902, opened a prayer association in a converted chapel at Hill Street, London 18 (Map), on 4 February 1911. Within a year, Hebrew Union College graduate Rabbi Israel Mattuck was appointed minister. By 1915, the congregation had 416 members and grew, reaching 784 in 1921. A permanent edifice at St John's Wood, with a capacity of 1,400 people and designed by architect Ernest Joseph, was dedicated on 13 September 1925. Leo Baeck, an internationally famous rabbi and Holocaust survivor, served as the synagogue's president. Lily Montagu was a spiritual as well as a lay leader at the synagogue and a member of the LJS Council from its inception until her death. Rabbi Mattuck conducted services until 1947, retiring to function as Rabbi Emeritus, and was replaced by his former assistant, Leslie Edgar. John Rayner was senior minister between 1961 and 1989. He was succeeded by David Goldberg, who was in turn replaced by Alexandra Wright in 2004. Current rabbis The synagogue's rabbis are Alexandra Wright (Senior Rabbi) and Igor Zinkov. Membership It had 1,622 registered members in 1940, rising to 2, 600 members in 1954 before peaking at 3, 000 in the mid-1970s. Membership levels fell to 2, 300 in the mid-1980s, reflecting wider synagogue trends and as more people moved out to the suburbs. According to a 2016 study by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research, the synagogue is in the category of 750 to 999 members by household. The synagogue has long attracted strong numbers of American expatriate families and rabbis ordained at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati (Fox 2011). Furthermore, it is considered the flagship congregation of Liberal Judaism, which in itself is considered ideologically closer to American Reform Judaism than it is to the Movement for Reform Judaism in the United Kingdom. Rituals and edifice Services at the Liberal Jewish Synagogue follow the prayerbooks of Liberal Judaism. The first prayerbook produced by Rabbi Mattuck appeared in 1912 and was influenced by American Reform Judaism and Rabbi David Einhorn's Olat Tamid. In 1962 a new Haggadah was produced by Rabbi John Rayner and Rabbi John Rich of South London Liberal Synagogue. In 1973 Rayner produced a new prayerbook, Service of the Heart to replace Mattuck's earlier prayerbooks. Rayner aimed to strike a balance between traditional and modern liturgical materials. The older establishment was happy to continue with Mattuck's more radical approach, while an increasing number of congregations felt the need for a more tradition kind of service and more Zionism. Service for the Heart was succeeded by Siddur Lev Chadash in 1995, again edited by Rayner. A successor, Siddur Shirah Chadashah is currently being produced. It will fulfil more closely the traditional concept of a siddur, that is a prayer book for Shabbat, the three daily services and for home ceremonies. Over the years, there has been a gradual re-introduction of some of the traditional rituals and forms of worship abandoned by the synagogue's early leaders. In the 1930s and 1940s the synagogue began to accommodate the different traditions of an increasing number of congregants that were refugees from Europe. The greater impetus for traditional rituals also came from the context of the Holocaust and the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. The conducting of the Kiddush began for the first time after the war and Friday night services were introduced in 1945. In the 1970s and 1980s, with the encouragement of Rabbi John Rayner and Rabbi David Goldberg, an increasing number of men began to wear a kippah, a practice which is now the norm. The rabbis also moved the congregation towards a greater use of Hebrew in the services. In 1912, Rabbi Mattuck introduced Confirmation ceremonies, marking a young person's graduation from the Religion School at the age of sixteen. At the time they did not exist in Anglo-Jewry, but were customary in Reform synagogues in the United States. The ceremonies later became known as Kabbalat Torah (Confirmation) by Rabbi Rayner, as a part of a trend towards the greater use of Hebrew. In the 1970s there was mounting pressure for the introduction of Bar and bat mitzvah ceremonies from congregants who felt that Confirmation at age sixteen was not sufficient. The synagogue agreed to introduce Bar and bat mitzvah ceremonies in 1981, with the understanding that the students will then continue with their later Kabbalat Torah studies. This continues to be the status quo at the synagogue. The original synagogue at the St John's Wood location was erected during 1924 and designed by Ernest Joseph, it was dedicated on 13 September 1925. The portico of the new synagogue consisted of six ionic columns made of Portland stone that were donated by Bernhard Baron, a philanthropist and synagogue member. Inside, there was seating for 1,350 people and a communal hall, named Montefiore Hall, which could accommodate a further 500 people. There were also several classrooms upstairs. In November 1940, during the Blitz, the building sustained heavy damage from an enemy bomb. It was restored, and reopened with a celebratory service on 24 September 1951. In 1984, the discovery of structural defects convinced the board to demolish and rebuild the sanctuary, whilst maintaining the original portico. The right to build flats above the new synagogue was sold to a developer to help subsidise the project. A concluding prayer was held on 30 April 1988, before relocating to a deconsecrated church hall in Loudoun Road near Swiss Cottage. Fitzroy Robinson & Partners was commissioned to design the shell of the new building. Israeli architects, Kantor Schwartz, working closely with Koski Solomon, were tasked with designing the Sanctuary. In 1988 the original portico was taken down and kept in storage for three years at the London Docklands while the new synagogue was being built. It was then cleaned and reinstated 1.2 metres from its original position. The front facade replicates the original facade of the 1925 building; the apparent windows are dummies to appear as in the original building. The entrance hall includes a memorial to the six million Jews who were murdered in the Shoah. The stone, a three-ton Kilkenny limestone, is the work of the eminent sculptor Anish Kapoor (born in Bombay of a Jewish mother in 1954). The Sanctuary was conceived as octagonal. The bimah and three lecterns are made of oak and is enclosed by a high curved wall of Jerusalem stone. The stone was quarried from Hebron by a family whose employees had traditional skills of tooling the stone. The wall was hand-finished in London by a team of Israelis. The ark was designed as the focus of the wall; the doors are a mesh of metals set in frames of bronze. The design and inset of the doors were carried out in Israel by sculptor Amit Schur, while the bronze frame and closing mechanism were manufactured under her direction in Sheffield. On 13 January 1991, the new edifice was dedicated and reconsecrated the following year. The building was praised in The Times newspaper by Religious Correspondent, Ruth Gledhill praising the five-star architecture, warmer atmosphere and the 'spiritual high'. In the 1990s the new building attracted a marked increase in weddings and press attention from the weddings of high-profile couples such as Simon Sebag Montefiore and his wife, Santa Montefiore. Activities The synagogue lent its support to refugees from Nazi Germany. Rabbi Mattuck raised funds to enable German refugees to come to England. The money that Mattuck raised allowed 156 refugees to escape persecution. Synagogue congregants assisted the refugees with securing employment and the Women's Society tried to ensure that the children they helped had a Jewish education, especially if they lived with non-Jewish families. The synagogue also hosted a club for German refugees, organising dances, lectures and music recitals (Fox 2011). The German refugees also began to run language lessons and conducted their own services. They eventually founded their own congregation, Belsize Square Synagogue. In the 1970s and 1980s the synagogue turned its attention towards the plight of Soviet Jewry, becoming particularly supportive of the refuseniks. An LJS Soviet Jewry Committee was established in 1977 by Doreen Isaacs. The members supported demonstrations and marches, they visited refusenik families in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and Odessa. They adopted refuseniks and sent messages of support, Rosh Hashanah cards, Chanukkah greetings and seder services for Passover.

{"text": "Gottmadingen is a municipality in the district of Konstanz, in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, situated on the Swiss border, 5 km southwest of Singen, and 12 km east of Schaffhausen. A first mention of Gottmadingen was in 965. Until the construction of the Singen - Schaffhausen railway line it was a tiny village. Economic growth began in the 20th century. Due to the high demand for workers in the new factories the number of inhabitants grew rapidly. Gottmadingen's industry was mainly based on the production of agricultural machinery. In the years 1960s and 1970s more than 4,000 workers were employed in the \"Fahr\" factory for agricultural engines. The factory was closed in 2003. Today's economy is based on several companies that settled on the former \"Fahr\" factory area. The municipal area of Gottmadingen comprises also the outlying villages of Bietingen, Ebringen and Randegg, as well as the hamlet Murbach. Both and itself have railway stations and benefit from rail connections to Schaffhausen and Singen. The village Randegg and the hamlet Murbach are served by buses from Switzerland with a connection to the Swiss villages Ramsen and Dörflingen as well as the city of Schaffhausen.

{"text": "The Last Wave of Summer is the sixth studio album by Australian pub rock band, Cold Chisel. It was released in October 1998 and reached number-one on The Australian ARIA Charts. It was the band's first studio album in 14 years. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999, the album was nominated for ARIA Award for Best Rock Album. Album details Released 14 years after Cold Chisel had released their last studio album (Twentieth Century), there was a considerable amount of speculation in the press before the release of The Last Wave of Summer. Walker stated that after so long apart, the band was curious and intrigued by the possibility of recording together, and felt everyone had improved as songwriters. He also said it was very inspiring swapping songs with other members of the band, especially considering their history. The band was not intending to progress to studio recording unless they deemed the songs were of sufficient quality. When Don Walker was asked how the band decided which songs to work on next, he replied, \"Psychological manipulation, sullen looks, petulance, tantrums, insane rages both faked and real, sexual coquettishness and pathological violence. Sometimes the last two together.\" Some early sessions were done with Paul McKercher and another with Rick Will, neither of which the band found satisfactory. Over a hundred songs were considered for the album over a 3-month rehearsal period, all recorded as demos at the Sydney Opera House. Barnes and Prestwich had both stockpiled songs. Walker, who had recently used songs for Moss's Petrolhead, Tex, Don and Charlie's Sad but True, and his own solo debut, felt he had little to offer. \"I didn't have much around. So a lot of that is written from a standing start. I assumed the reunion album was going to be largely written by the other guys and I was quite relaxed about that.\" The band had signed an unusual contract with Mushroom Records, a partnership whereby the band would split all expenses and profits with the label. The contract also stipulated that the label would have no creative input whatsoever. Barnes described the recording process as, \"very unorthodox. Normally when you record, everyone wears headphones and everything is isolated, so if someone makes a mistake you can cut it out. We had a PA in the studio - everything bled through everything else. What it meant was we had to record virtually live. So it's an album that's got lots of warts on it, little things that are technically wrong, but at the same time it has an immense amount of feel.\" Elsewhere he said, \"You can almost hear the guitars going slightly out of tune as the song progresses because Mossy's hammering away.\" Walker later said, \"Last Wave of Summer was a production nightmare. There hadn't been much growing up done in the previous 15 years, or all the growing had been in the wrong direction.\" The album covers topics ranging from the serious, including the Australian Aboriginal stolen generation in the Ian Moss penned \"Red Sand\" and judicial inequity in Don Walker's \"Mr. Crown Prosecutor\", to the flippant, such as the pub adventure \"Yakuza Girls\". The cover photo, by Adrienne Overall, of the band seated at a service station in Wyong, New South Wales, references Edward Hopper's Nighthawks. A rockabilly version of \"Yakuza Girls\" appeared on Don Walker's 2006 solo album Cutting Back. Reception Allmusic described the album as a, \"less visceral; more cerebral,\" album by, \"an older, more mature Chisel -- accomplished songsmiths and musicians with nothing left to prove.\" It's noted that, \"there's a shade less catchiness to this album than, say, Breakfast at Sweethearts or East.\" Barnes' vocals have, \"never sounded better or bitten harder.\" Michael Smith from Drum Media said the album opened and closed, \"with a couple of swamp rockers that remind you that the Cruel Sea and Beasts of Bourbon didn't write the book,\" and closed by saying the album was, \"a damned fine addition to the catalogue of one of the real musical treasures of this country.\" The Age wrote, \"Barnesy's voice is its best in years, and Don Walker lyrics are, as ever, thoughtful. Because of its bluesy feel, the album will be as welcome at a yuppie dinner party as at a Chisel fan's piss-up.\" Track listing All tracks written by Don Walker, except as noted. \"Mr. Crown Prosecutor\" - 3:19 \"The Things I Love in You\" - 3:18 \"Baby's On Fire\" - 3:03 \"Way Down\" (Steve Prestwich) - 3:56 \"Bal-A-Versailles\" - 4:59 \"Yakuza Girls\" - 2:29 \"He Can't Believe It's Over With You\" - 3:53 \"Angel In My Room\" (Jimmy Barnes) - 3:40 \"Never Stop Loving You\" (Barnes) - 3:59 \"Red Sand\" (Ian Moss, Peter Moss, Cal Curtis) - 4:53 \"Pretty Little Thing\" - 3:12 \"So Hard\" - 3:48 \"Water into Wine\" (Prestwich) - 4:54 \"The Last Wave Of Summer\" - 6:01 In addition to these, the album has a hidden track written by Phil Small & Jim Barnes entitled: \"Once around the Sun\" Subsequent re-issues expanded the album to twenty tracks, including the following in addition to the original 14 tracks, and re-ordered the original track listing.

{"text": "Gaddesby is a village and civil parish in the Melton borough of Leicestershire, England. The population of the civil parish (including Ashby Folville and Barsby) at the 2011 census was 762. It is located around southwest of Melton Mowbray and northeast of Leicester. Gaddesby has 170 households and a population of around 450, while the parish, which includes the nearby villages of Ashby Folville and Barsby, has a total population of 762 according to the 2011 Census. Recent housing development has made Gaddesby a popular, rural dormitory for Leicester. History Gaddesby's name is derived from the Old Norse words gaddr and by, meaning 'farm/settlement of Gaddr' or 'farm/settlement on a hill spur', indicating that it was a settlement during the Danish occupation of England between the 9th and 11th centuries. It is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Gadesbi, a mainly pastoral village with a mill, within the hundred of Goscote. Parish Church The Grade I listed St Luke's Church was originally built as a Norman chapel - a single space without a tower. It was part of the soke of Rothley from the tenth century. The two aisles, North and South, the tower and the Chancel were added in the thirteenth century and elaborated in the next two hundred years. The church is reputed to have some of the finest examples of fourteenth century stonework in the country which adorn the South West corner on the outside of the Knights Templar's chapel. The oak pews in the nave are probably fifteenth century and the limestone font dates from 1320. There is a peal of eight bells, the earliest dated 1562. The size of the church attests to the importance of the village during the period of its development. Gaddesby had grown as a result of the importance of the wool industry in East Leicestershire. Indeed, it had a weekly market and an annual fair from the fourteenth century. As the wool industry declined and the Western half of the county rose in prominence during the Industrial Revolution so Gaddesby settled back into being a rural backwater. The near life-size marble sculpture of a dying horse and rider on a marble chest, created by Joseph Gott in memory of Colonel Edward Hawkins Cheney, C.B., of the Scots Greys, was originally at Gaddesby Hall. It was moved to the chancel in 1917. The Hall Gaddesby Hall was built on the site of an earlier house called Paske Hall, which was surrounded by a moat and dated back to 1390. This old hall was pulled down in 1744 and the present hall erected. The houses in the village formed part of the estate of Gaddesby Hall. Over the years the hall had several owners, including the Nedham, Ayre and Cheney families, all of whom are commemorated in the church. The estate was put up for sale in 1917, at which time the celebrated statue of Colonel Cheney was moved into St Luke's. After suffering neglect and from its use by the American Armed Forces during the Second World War, the hall was reduced in size and renovated during the 1950s. Notable features The village had many springs, and there are still two water pumps in Chapel Lane. On the corner of Chapel Lane and Cross Street, a large boulder called \"the blue stone\" marks a spot from which John Wesley is reputed to have preached. The Methodist chapel was demolished in 1966. Many listed and older properties, including former hunting lodges, still exist. An old windmill remains just outside Gaddesby. A cross country running race, the Gaddesby Gallop, is organised before Christmas. Canon Peter Spink (1926–2010), Anglican priest, was born here.

{"text": "was a Japanese manga artist. Known as the Master of Gag Manga, he created many popular manga such as Osomatsu-kun, Himitsu no Akko-chan, and Tensai Bakabon. Biography He was born in Rehe, Manchuria, the son of a Japanese military police officer. After World War II, he grew up in Niigata Prefecture and Nara Prefecture. When he was 19, he moved to Tokyo. While working at a chemical factory, he drew many manga. After that, Tokiwa-so accepted him. He started his career as a shōjo artist, but in 1958, his Nama-chan (ナマちゃん) became a hit, so he became a specialist in comic manga. He won the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1964 for Osomatsu-kun and the Bungeishunjū Manga Award in 1971 for Tensai Bakabon. He is said to have been influenced by Buster Keaton and MAD magazine. In 1965, Akatsuka established his own company \"Fujio Productions Ltd.\". In 2000, he drew manga in braille for the blind. Many of his manga featured supporting characters who ended up becoming more popular and more associated with their series than the main character, such as Papa (Tensai Bakabon), Iyami, Chibita (Osomatsu-kun), and Nyarome (Mōretsu Atarō). In April 2002 he was hospitalized for intra-axial hematoma and was said to frequently be in a persistent vegetative state from 2004 until his death. In July 2006, his second wife Machiko, who had been nursing him, suddenly died from a subarachnoid hemorrhage. On August 2, 2008, he died of pneumonia at a hospital in Bunkyō, Tokyo. Works Among Akatsuka's extensive body of work, his series of Osomatsu-kun, Himitsu no Akko-chan, Tensai Bakabon, and Mōretsu Atarō are often considered his top four major series by Fujio Pro, due to their success in garnering animated adaptations and their lengthy runs and revivals.

He represented Renfrew South in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1867 to 1871 and in the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal from 1869 to 1872 and from 1874 to 1878. He was born in Golden Lake, Ontario, Upper Canada in 1838, the son of John Lorn McDougall, Sr. He studied at the High School of Montreal and then at the University of Toronto. He entered his father's business in Renfrew, taking over the operation of the business in 1860 when his father died. He served several terms as reeve of Renfrew and also was warden for Renfrew County. His lumber business failed in 1878 and, shortly afterward, he was named to the post of Auditor General of Canada. The Public Accounts Audit Act of 1878 established an auditor general who was independent of government financial operations and had some degree of independence from the party in power. His attention to detail, efforts to tighten controls on government spending, and persistence ruffled some feathers, but ultimately helped establish the importance of this role. Unfortunately, because his office relied on information provided by government departments, some instances of fraud went undetected. Despite resistance from government departments, he helped improve financial control by parliament and established annual reports on government spending. He resigned in 1905 and opened a private company that performed audits for companies and municipalities. He died in Ottawa in 1909 after suffering a series of strokes. He was appointed CMG in the 1897 Diamond Jubilee Honours.

{"text": "The Yamaha XS Eleven motorcycle, also called XS11 and XS1100, is a Japanese standard produced from 1977 (MY1978) to 1983, powered by an air-cooled 4-stroke, DOHC inline four-cylinder engine mounted transversely in a duplex cradle frame with swingarm rear suspension, shaft drive, and telescopic forks. History & Technology The XS Eleven was the first four-cylinder four-stroke motorcycle from Yamaha. It built on technology first used by Yamaha in their earlier XS 750 four-stroke triple. However, the XS 1100 engine design was in reality a completely new design with several relatively unconventional elements when compared to other inline 4-cylinder motorcycle engines of the day. The \"over-square\" design of the XS 1100 engine (Bore: 71.5 mm x Stroke: 68.6 mm) is different than the \"under-square\" XS 750 engine which had a larger stroke than bore. The camshaft drive chain moved to the center of the engine. The XS1100 engine does not transmit power directly from the crankshaft to the clutch basket/input shaft, but rather via a wide hy-vo chain onto an intermediate jack-shaft with a cush-drive damper. The engine rotation was therefore clockwise when viewed from the left side and not counterclockwise as all other inline four-cylinder motorcycle engines of the day. This jackshaft included a \"cush-drive\" shock damper needed for drive shaft drive trains. The starter also engaged the jackshaft to start the engine. The engine is mounted in rubber bushings making it an almost completely vibration-free running powerplant. A significant advancement of the XS 1100 engine are the combustion chambers. To make adequate power most modern motorcycle engines of the day including the XS 750 had simple hemispherical combustion chambers with domed pistons. This design has a major drawback in relatively long flame travel during combustion and therefore requires much spark advance, which in turn can cause severe preignition in high-performance engines. To improve combustion efficiency while virtually eliminating the possibility of preignition, Yamaha designed multi-angle \"polyspheric\" combustion chambers that required six different machining processes during manufacturing. This new design allowed for high compression without a large piston domes and large ignition advance. The XS 1100 valves were the same as previously used in the XS 750 engine, but their angle differed from the previous 3-cylinder engine. Carburetion was delivered by four Mikuni BS34 II constant velocity (CV) carburetors and ignition via a contactless, transistorized electronic ignition unit (TCI) with vacuum advance. When the XS Eleven was introduced, it earned a reputation as a heavy, powerful and reliable bike. It was the fastest-ever production bike in 1978, for the first time posting a sub-12 second 1/4 mile time (11.78 sec. @ 114.21 mph with a top speed of 135 mph - Cycle World 2/78). In 1978 and 1979 it won Cycle World's Ten Best Bikes as the best Touring bike. \"Nobody gets far riding the XS Eleven before they become acquainted with the fact that it's strong; we had ridden ours over hundreds of open-road miles before going to the drag strip and knew it was a bullet.\" Cycle Magazine had this to say of the Eleven: \"...the XS is a Rolls Royce with a blown Chrysler Hemi motor...\" The handling of the XS Eleven was not as well received. \"When this behemoth of a motorcycle actually hits a corner at anything approaching interesting speeds then it takes a good deal of muscle to lay it down. While the Yamaha doesn't disgrace itself in corners (not as much as some Z1000s I have known, for example) it doesn't commend itself either.\" Testers of the day all echoed the same story: \"The XS1100 was a solid bullet in a straight line, but cornering at high speeds was done at your own risk.\" \"Cycle warned its readers that the bike could easily go, stop and steer — just never two at the same time.\" 'Which Bike' magazine simply described the XS1100 as having 'a bullet proof motor, and tea trolley handling'. North American models The XS Eleven made its debut in September 1977 (MY 1978) as the largest displacement motorcycle in production at that time. It featured a four-cylinder dual overhead cam engine, dual front disc brakes, a rear disc brake, shaft drive and cast aluminum wheels. The XS Eleven was the most powerful mass-production motorcycle of the late 70s and posted superior performance numbers compared to its competition. The US market XS Eleven was launched as the so-called \"Standard\" model (Versions: E - 1978, F - 1979 and G - 1980-81). In 1979 Yamaha followed the growing market trend for \"factory custom\" motorcycles by offering the XS Eleven SF \"Special\". Pullback handlebars, a stepped seat, a 16-inch rear wheel, a smaller capacity tear-drop gas tank, and an adjustable suspension with new air-assisted front forks created this factory custom, forerunner of the modern cruiser. The XS Eleven Special sold well in the US. Despite complaints about the poor ergonomics \"What that translates to is a bike with an awkward riding position but generally excellent road manners. In fact, most of the things that irritated this staff in the way the bike rode and handled could be traced to the handlebar, which, although certainly as trendy as disco dancing, was not what the ergonomics doctor ordered for precise, comfortable control.\", it became the by far best-selling XS Eleven variant in the US market. In 1980 the XS Eleven LH \"Midnight Special\" was launched in all global markets including the US. It was basically an all black and gold version of the XS Eleven SF Special. Beginning with the 1980 model year from September 1979 numerous changes were made to all XS Eleven engines in order to comply with more stringent US emission regulations. The compression ratio was dropped from 9.2:1 to 9.0:1 via changes to the pistons and cylinder head, changing the shape of the combustion chamber. The intake valve size was increased from 36 mm to 38 mm and the exhaust valve size from 31 mm to 32 mm in an attempt to compensate for the reduction in compression ratio. Cam timing and cam profiles however remained unchanged. The 34mm Mikuni CV carbs remained in use but received different jetting and settings. From 1980 on there were no longer pilot jet adjustment screws installed. The jet needle was set in its leanest position. The main jets which were # 137.5 in all four carbs on 1978 and 1979 models, were reduced to #115 main jets in carbs two and three (center carbs) and # 120 main jets in carbs one and four (outside carbs). While Yamaha maintained identical performance specs on paper, period tests confirmed a slight reduction in the performance of the bike. These bikes never broke into the 11-second quarter mile as the 78-79 models had. Tests also commented that cold start and warm-up behavior had worsened noticeably and required unusually long operation of the cold start enrichment system. These 1980 - on \"emission\" XS Eleven bikes were easy to spot since a kickstarter shaft was no longer installed in the transmission and the kickstarter lever was no longer provided. For the 1981 model year a dedicated touring model of the XS Eleven was launched, called the XS Eleven \"Venturer\". It was equipped with a full touring fairing made by Pacifico for Yamaha. XS Eleven Venturers also came with matching panniers and a top case. Additionally, the Venturer included the 6.3 gallon tank from the EU/RoW XS 1100 for an increased range and the oil cooler system of the EU/RoW XS1100. The volume production of the XS Eleven really ended in 1981 in all markets and most XS Eleven models were superseded by the one-year-only 1982 XJ1100 Maxim, which used an advanced version of the XS1100 engine. In Europe however because of the importance of more sporting motorcycles, the XS 1.1 S was built as a \"sport\" model until 1982 (MY 1983) to bridge the gap until Yamaha could introduce the MY 1984 FJ 1100 (and subsequently FJ1200) sport-tourers in 1983. European market XS 1100 In Europe the XS 1100 \"Standard\" was by far the most popular model of the XS 1100 line-up. There the XS 1100 remained in production until 1983. The European Yamaha XS 1100 Standard (2H9) model differed considerably from the North American XS 1100 Standard (2H7) model (Versions: E - 1978, F - 1979 and G - 1980-81). The EU XS 1100 Standard was equipped with a larger gas tank (6.3 gallons vs. 5.3 gallons), dual horns and an EU-specific narrower, lower handlebar. The rider footpegs of the EU XS 1100 were mounted on different rear sets that positioned them higher and further back on the frame for more clearance. This required a shorter rear brake lever and a special linkage for a reversely mounted shift lever to work with these rear sets. Combined with the EU handlebar these rear sets allowed for a sportier riding position than the more relaxed, laid-back position of the US model. The EU and RoW XS1100 Standard had satin black painted engines equipped from the factory with an oil cooler system, while the US engines were all natural, unpainted aluminum (except for the Midnight Special which was all black) without an oil cooler system. Further, the rear fender of the EU version was longer and the rear turn signals were mounted to the license plate holder instead of to the rear frame as in the US version. Many EU versions also had a separate steering head lock welded to the left side of the steering head as required by law in various EU countries. While having been the by far most popular model in the US, the 1979 - 1981 XS 1100 SF \"Special\" sold rather poorly in Europe. It was, except for differences required by law, identical to the US model. The European market also featured two limited production models: The 1979 XS1100 Martini with a two-piece fairing designed by John Mockett, sporting a Martini color scheme similar to the bike that Mike Hailwood used as his personal transport at the 1978 Isle of Man TT. Only 500 \"Martinis\" were ever built exclusively for the EU market of which 274 were sold in Germany alone and 65 in the UK. The second limited-production model was the 1981 - 1983 XS 1.1 Sport. A sporty version largely based on the XS 1100 Special but laid out more as a sports bike with a small cockpit fairing. Only 320 XS 1.1 S were sold since it was a gap-filler model. Yamaha recognized the change in market demands for more sporty bikes and built the XS 1.1 S to bridge this gap until the new FJ 1100 was ready for sale. Both of these limited production models were not available to the US market. Production of the XS 1100 LH \"Midnight Special\" built from 1980 to 1982 was also limited, but to greater numbers, and it was sold in all global markets. Racing: Production and Modified Classes The XS11 dominated the 1978 Australian motorcycle production racing circuit in 1978 and continued to victories and high place finishes in production and superbike classes through 1981. The XS Eleven's win at the 1978 Castrol Six Hour production endurance race by the Pittman's Team of Jim Budd and Roger Heyes was Yamaha's first four stroke motorcycle road racing victory at a major international event. \"A key component of the race from the very start was that the motorcycles had to be completely stock, exactly as available the day after the race in dealers’ showrooms around the world, and they were rigorously inspected in both pre-race and post-race scrutineering to ensure that they were\" Flack of Motor Sport Retro wrote: \"While the new CBX1000 and Suzuki were out and out sports bikes, the shaft-drive XS1100, affectionately called the 'Xcessive', was more of a muscle bike come tourer. Heavier than and not as fast as its rivals, the XS1100 did have one particular ability – winning races.\" \"In the lead up to the Six-Hour, the XS1100 had swept the Adelaide Three-Hour, the Perth Four-Hour and the Surfers Three-Hour. The unlikely XS1100 and Pitman Yamaha rider Greg Pretty had upstaged the biggest, baddest production bikes around, confounding everyone.\" In the 1979 Castrol 6 hour, XS Elevens finished second (Greg Pretty, Jim Budd) third (Len Atlee, Gary Coleman) and fourth (Roger Heyes and D. Robbins) The XS Eleven's successful racing career was a remarkable achievement considering its shaft drive and long distance touring capabilities. British motorcycle journalist Roland Brown, says in his book Superbikes of the Seventies: \"The Yamaha's lack of reputation gives it one advantage these days, though, in that a clean XS such as this one costs less than its more successful contemporary rivals – whose performance advantage, so crucial then, is far less important now. Two decades and more after its launch, maybe the XS1100's time has finally come.\" Performance In a 1978 test by Cycle World a stock XS1100 ran a quarter mile time of 11.78 s 1/4 mile @ with a top speed of .

{"text": "George Howell (5 October 1833 – 17 September 1910) was an English trade unionist and reform campaigner and a Lib-Lab politician, who sat in the House of Commons from 1885 to 1895. Biography George Howell was born in Wrington, Somerset, the eldest of eight children of a builder and contractor. He was educated at a Church of England primary school in Bristol until the age of twelve, when he began work with his father, who owned a small builders. By the week he worked twelve hours a day as a mortar-boy, and later a bricklayer, but dedicated Sundays to reading. Among his favourite books were John Foxe's Book of Martyrs and John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress. Howell grew to dislike his work as a builder so became an apprentice shoemaker. Some of the men he worked with were active chartists and introduced him to radical newspapers including the Northern Star and the Red Republican. As a result, he joined the chartist movement in 1848. Others of his colleagues were Methodists, and Howell attended some of their meetings at Wrington Chapel, before becoming a lay preacher. He also became involved in the local temperance movement. Howell moved to London in 1854 where he resumed work as a bricklayer, unable to find employment as a shoemaker. He attended many radical political meetings and met prominent radical thinkers of the day, including Karl Marx, George Holyoake, Charles Bradlaugh and Frederic Harrison. He joined the Operative Bricklayers' Society (a New Model Trade Union) in 1859, and played a part in leading the London builders' strike in support of a nine-hour working day. Through his work with the union he became one of the foremost New Model unionists, along with Robert Applegarth and George Potter, but was blacklisted by employers for five years. He was elected, along with Potter and Applegarth, to the executive of the London Trades Council (LTC) in 1861 and became its secretary. He also became involved in the campaign for universal suffrage, becoming full-time secretary of the Reform League in 1865. Howell organised demonstrations in London in 1866 and 1867, and played an important role in the campaign behind the 1867 Reform Act. However, Howell was not satisfied with the scale of the reform and continued to campaign for universal suffrage. In 1871 Howell was appointed secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), and regularly contributed to the trade unionist journal The Bee-Hive as well as publishing a number of books throughout the 1870s. Howell stood for parliament unsuccessfully at Aylesbury in the general elections of 1868 and 1874 and at Stafford in a by-election in 1881. He finally succeeded in 1885 as Lib–Lab candidate for Bethnal Green North East, London. In Parliament, Howell helped to pass the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 and successfully defended his seat in 1886 and 1892 but was defeated by the Conservative Mancherjee Bhownagree in 1895. In poor health, Howell retired from public life. His old friend Robert Applegarth and the TUC raised a £1650 testimonial to buy him an annuity before his death. On 17 September 1910, he died at 35 Findon Road, Shepherd's Bush, and was buried at Nunhead Cemetery.

{"text": "The Village is a narrative poem by George Crabbe, published in 1783. The poem contrasts the traditional representation of the rural idyll in Augustan poetry with the realities of village life. History In early 1781 Crabbe wrote a letter to statesman and author Edmund Burke asking for help, in which he included samples of his poetry. Among the samples that Crabbe sent to Burke were pieces of his poems The Library and The Village which Burke viewed favourably, giving Crabbe a gift of money to relieve his immediate wants, and assuring him that he would do all in his power to further Crabbe's literary career. The Village was published in May 1783. Critical reception Samuel Johnson said of the poem in a letter to Reynolds, \"I have sent you back Mr. Crabbe's poem, which I read with great delight. It is original, vigorous, and elegant.\" Johnson's friend and biographer James Boswell also praised The Village. It was said at the time of publication that Johnson had made extensive changes to the poem, but Boswell responded by saying that \"the aid given by Johnson to the poem, as to The Traveller and Deserted Village of Goldsmith, were so small as by no means to impair the distinguished merit of the author.\" References Sources External links 1783 poems Poetry by George Crabbe"}

She was at the peak of her popularity during the 1930s. She was married from August 1934 until 1939 to Basil Dean, a British stage and film writer, director and producer. Dean reportedly grew interested in Hooper due to her resemblance to a former lover of his, actress Meggie Albanesi (died 1923). Dean promoted Hopper's career and cast her as the leading lady in several major films for Associated Talking Pictures in the mid-1930s. However, the films did badly at the box office and her career waned. Two films she was scheduled to appear in, Grace Darling and Come Live with Me, never materialised.

{"text": "Kingsley Terence Black (born 22 June 1968) is a former professional footballer who played as a midfielder from 1987 until 2002, He notably featured in the Premier League for Nottingham Forest, and also had spells with Luton Town and Grimsby Town where he picked up honours for both clubs. He also appeared in the Football League for Sheffield United and Millwall before finishing his career with Lincoln City. Born in England, he was capped 30 times by Northern Ireland, scoring 1 goal. Early life Black was born in Luton to an English mother and a Northern Irish father who came from Castlerock in County Londonderry. Club career Luton Town Black started his career with his home town club of Luton Town where he notched up just under 150 appearances for the club in all competitions between 1987 and 1991. He won the League Cup with Luton Town in 1988. He also scored twice at Derby County on the final day of season 1989-90 as Luton dramatically avoided relegation by winning 3–2; thus relegating Ron Atkinson's Sheffield Wednesday side. Nottingham Forest Black was then signed for £1.5 million by Brian Clough for Nottingham Forest. Although becoming a first team regular at Forest, Black soon fell out with his manager only months into his career at the City Ground and found himself transfer listed. He scored the winner in a 3–2 victory over Southampton in the 1992 Full Members' Cup final at Wembley, and was also part of the team who lost 1992 EFL Cup final to Manchester United. Clough retired at the end of the 1992–93 season with Forest relegated from the Premier League. Black returned to regular football the following year and was part of the side who earned promotion straight back to the top flight. With the emergence of Ian Woan and Steve Stone, Black found himself out of favour and was eventually loaned out twice, making appearances for Sheffield United and Millwall. Black managed over 100 appearances before his departure to Grimsby Town for £25,000 in early 1996. Grimsby Town Black slotted into the Mariners midfield but was unable to stop the club losing their First Division status. Despite the relegation Black committed himself to the Mariners, even though the club struggled early in the 1997–98 season, Town went on to finish third in the league. Promotion was achieved via the play-offs after the club beat Fulham and Northampton Town. The Mariners also saw success in the Football League Trophy in which they defeated AFC Bournemouth at Wembley Stadium. Bournemouth led in the game before Black made the tie all square to send the game into extra time. Wayne Burnett scored the golden goal to send Grimsby home with the trophy. Black went on to feature for Grimsby in the first division for the next three seasons. When manager Alan Buckley was sacked in September 2000, he was replaced by Lennie Lawrence who in turn brought in midfielders Menno Willems, Knut Anders Fostervold, Neil Murray and most notably Leicester City youngster Stuart Campbell. With this Black found it hard to get a look in with the club, but avoided the chop unlike unfavoured utility man Adam Buckley. Black was instead put up for loan, and joined Lincoln City. The Imps would later appoint former Grimsby boss Alan Buckley as their new manager. Black returned to Blundell Park towards the end of the season and was deemed surplus to requirements by Lawrence. Despite being held in high regard by the club's supporters, Black was released from the club. Lincoln City After his release from Grimsby, he joined other former Grimsby players Adam Buckley, Ian Hamilton and Andy Smith by joining Lincoln City. Black's spell at Lincoln was marred by the club's overall poor performance, and the financial turmoil it was in, which would later see the club enter into administration towards the end of the season. Alan Buckley left the club by mutual consent, and in came another former Grimsby Town player Keith Alexander as the new manager. Financially, Lincoln were saved, and they escaped relegation to the Football Conference. Having featured only featured once in the 2002–2003 season, as a substitute in the 3–0 home victory over Macclesfield Town on 26 August 2002, Black agreed to leave the Imps by mutual consent, reaching a satisfactory agreement of a severance deal on 10 October 2002. Black decided to retire from the game at the age 34 despite being offered several contracts from other clubs. International career Having previously been capped at England U18 level, Black switched allegiance to Northern Ireland, the birthplace of his father. He received caps at U21 and U23 level before earning his first full international cap in a 0-0 friendly draw with France on 27 April 1988. He scored his only goal on 19 October 1991 in a 2–1 win over Austria in a qualifying match for Euro 92. Overall he was capped 30 times with his final game being a 2–0 victory over Romania on 23 March 1994. Black was never selected again but did play for the Northern Ireland B team until 1999. Personal life He returned to Grimsby to play in John McDermott's testimonial against Hull City in 2005 in which he was joined by the majority of his former teammates from the 1997/1998 season. In 2008, he played in an exhibition match with the players from the Luton League cup win in honour of the late David Preece. After retiring from the game, Black still lives in Luton with his son Charles and daughter Tabitha. Black also has a holiday home in Majorca, where he co-owns a small charcuterie selling cured local meats and sausages.

{"text": "Nakhon Suvarnabhumi () was a proposed new province of Thailand in southeast Bangkok around Suvarnabhumi Airport. It was planned to include the districts Lat Krabang and Prawet of Bangkok and Bang Sao Thong and Bang Phli of Samut Prakan Province, an area of 521 km2 with about 462,000 residents. The proposal was announced in October 2005, with a draft bill approved by the cabinet in June 2006. According to the bill, for the first four years the province would be run by a governor appointed by the Interior Ministry and supervised by a 30 member administrative board chaired by the prime minister. After four years the administrative board would be dissolved, but the final administrative structure of the province was never set. It was planned to become a special administrative zone, probably having an elected governor like Bangkok. A final bill was scheduled to be submitted after the political crisis of 2006, however after the coup d'état the project died. The creation of a new province and development of the area around the airport was criticized by several groups, most notably the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. The previously unsettled areas were used as part of the flood-prevention system of Bangkok, and may have been compromised by further urbanization in the area. The plan also received a negative response in surveys of the local population. The proposal was withdrawn by a resolution of the cabinet dated 3 April 2007.

{"text": "San Biagio di Callalta ([san ˈbjad͡ʒːo di kalˈlalta], San Biajo [saŋ ˈbjajo] in Venetian) is a comune (municipality) in the province of Treviso, Veneto, north-eastern Italy. It is the birthplace of Pierre Cardin. History Ancient history Today's San Biagio di Callalta was once inhabited by Veneti, an Indo-European population that settled in north-eastern Italy after the middle of the second millennium BCE and developed its own original civilization during the next millennium. During Roman times the Veneto was part of Regio X Venetia et Histria. The territory gained greater importance thanks to the construction of the Via Annia, the Via Postumia and a road that connected them. Artifacts of that period have been found in the hamlets of Rovarè (terracotta fragments) and Spercenigo (funeral urn and a wine amphora) along with a cremation furnace ruin in Ca'Lion. San Biagio di Callalta gets its name from San Biagio (bishop and martyr) and to the military road \"Callis Alta\", originally built in the 10th or 11th century, after the original ancient route between Tarvisium and Opitergium had been abandoned. In the late Roman period (3rd and 4th century CE) two sites are mentioned that were in the territory of what was to become San Biagio: Prandecinum, corresponding to present day Rovarè, and Caurillium, corresponding to present day Cavriè. Middle Ages With the advent of Christianity, in these two sites, two churches were erected: Santa Maria de Caurillium, one of the first churches named as part of the new Diocese of Tarvisium and San Lorenzo in Prandecino, which was destroyed in the first decades of the nineteenth century. Other ancient churches in the territory of San Biagio are San Martino, San Floriano, San Menna, San Sisto a Nerbon, built over an ancient mound, the church of Spercenigo and the old parish church of San Biagio, built in the late 1300s but now in ruins. At the end of the tenth century, the territories of the future San Biagio were part of the area of influence of the powerful Abbey of Monastier. The work of the Benedictine monks here led to the development of the settlements of Rovarè, Fagarè and San Andrea di Barbarana. In 1314 the parish known as “Caurille” moved south of the “Callis Alta” military road and embankments that were built to counteract the floods of the Piave River. Thus starting from the fourteenth century along this road a new town arose – San Biagio, the current municipal capital – with the resulting decline of Cavriè and Pradencino. The “Callalta” divided the territory of San Biagio into two parts: the part to the North belonged to the Zosagna di Sopra (from 1339, Venice provided an administrative arrangement of the Treviso territory or podesteria, which encompassed San Biagio) and included the localities of Cavriè, Valdrigo, Camporocoler, San Biagio, Campolongo, Fagarè, Volta di Fagarè and Villatella, the South belonged to Zosagna di Sotto and included Spercenigo, Bagnon, Rovarè, Riva de Perdencin, Nerbon, San Florian and Villa Cucca. The area had fallen into the orbit of Treviso and followed its fate until the final inclusion in the Republic of Venice, at the end of the fourteenth century. During the period of the Republic of Venice, San Biagio enjoyed relative tranquility. Venice needed access to large quantities of oak and beech timber. The island city itself was devoid of any forests, so it turned to its mainland holdings for this vital resource. Magnificent villas were built here, erected by the nobles and patricians of Venice, including the Sugana, Sala, Giudici, Da Lezze, Navagero and Caotorta. Modern Era The territory was administered by the Republic of Venice until its fall of May 12, 1797. After the signing of the Treaty of Campo Formio and the assignment of the territory to Austria, the area was part of the Habsburg Empire. The territory remained (more or less) under Austrian sovereignty until the outcome of the Third War of Italian Independence, when the Armistice of Cormons transferred the Veneto to the Kingdom of Italy which was ratified with the signing of the Treaty of Vienna (1866) on October 3, 1866. San Biagio was affected by the consequences of the outbreak of the First world war especially after the Battle of Caporetto in 1917. Then the front line moved to the Piave River and forced the people of the area to exit to the Po Valley while the Austro-Hungarian armed forces bombarded their home territory causing considerable damage. The involvement reached its peak, when in June 1918, the Battle of the Solstice was fought here. This was the last great offensive launched by the Austro-Hungarians during the conflict and the Italian Army held, turning the tide of the war. To commemorate the tragic event, the ossuary of Fagarè was erected, along the Callalta Road, where the Austro-Hungarian troops reached their furthest advance. The ossuary contains two famous quotations: \"Tutti eroi! O il Piave, o tutti accoppati!” — Everyone a hero! Either the Piave, or be killed! “È meglio un giorno da leone che cento anni da pecora.\" — It is better to spend one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.

{"text": "Goldbach is a market community in the Aschaffenburg district in the Regierungsbezirk of Lower Franconia (Unterfranken) in Bavaria, Germany. Geography Location The market community is one of the most heavily populated communities in the Aschaffenburg district and is well known for the “housing” that encloses the Autobahn A 3. It is believed that the name has its roots in the yellow loess soil, which during heavy rainfalls colours the local brook, also called the Goldbach, with a somewhat golden tinge. Gold is also the German word for gold, and Bach means “brook”. Supposedly, the place was first called Gelbbach, gelb being the word for “yellow”. Constituent communities On 1 July 1971, the formerly self-administering community of Unterafferbach was amalgamated with Goldbach. History In 1218, Goldbach had its first documentary mention. From the mid 15th century, Goldbach was under the authority of the Archbishop of Mainz. In 1814, Goldbach was transferred to Bavaria. On 26 May 1995, Goldbach was granted the designation Markt (“Market”). Politics Community council The council is made up of 24 council members, not counting the mayor. (as at municipal election held on 2 March 2008) Coat of arms The community’s arms might be described thus: Gules a bend wavy Or, in chief a noble coronet argent set with colourful stones, in base a wheel spoked of six of the third. The German blazon describes the coronet as a Laubkrone, or “leaf crown”. The “bend wavy Or” – that is to say, wavy slanted golden stripe – is canting. As explained above, the community’s name means “Gold Brook”, and this bend is a visual representation of just such a thing. From the 7th to the 11th century, Goldbach belonged to the area of the Frankish royal estate, which is what the crown symbolizes. Until 1803, Goldbach found itself under Electoral Mainz hegemony, a fact recalled by the Wheel of Mainz on the other side of the bend. The tinctures Or and gules (gold and red) are taken from the arms once borne by the Counts of Rieneck, who until they died out in 1559 held the Vogtei as the vassals of the Archbishop of Mainz. The arms have been borne since 1965. Town partnerships Courseulles-sur-Mer, Calvados, France since 1994; the commune lies at Juno Beach. Culture and sightseeing Churches Goldbach has two Catholic parish churches. The alte Kirche (“old church”), as Saint Nicholas’s Church (St. Nikolaus-Kirche) is called, is found in the old village centre. The sandstone Romanesque Revival church that exists today was built in 1894 and 1895 on the spot where once there was an older building that had become too small. The newer church was later enlarged by adding a modern annex. In the west of the community, which at the time was a new development area, the modern church St. Maria Immaculata was consecrated in 1961, as Saint Nicholas’s had itself become too small to accommodate the community’s growing numbers. The plain clinker-brick building with a 37 m-tall asymmetrical tower seats 600. The chancel is graced by a monumental painting by the artist Curd Lessig as well as by a modern octagonal altar lamp whose ornate glass panes depicts Biblical scenes. One peculiarity of the church is its organ threesome. Besides the main organ with its 36 speaking stops, built in 1964 by the organ building firm Michael Weise, the church also has at its disposal a Baroque organ from 1782 that was thoroughly restored in the early 1980s and a positive organ from Hartwig Späth’s workshop. At community limits with Hösbach, the Evangelical Johanneskirche (“Saint John’s Church”) is situated. Sport and clubs In Goldbach there is a lively sport, culture and club life. Drawing attention from well beyond the region is the Winterlaufserie (“Winter Run Series”), carried on TV Goldbach, which is said to cover 10 km on each of nine appointed times. Further clubs are VfR Goldbach, AC Bavaria Goldbach, Gesangverein Harmonie Goldbach (singing club), Gesangverein Sängerkranz Goldbach (singing club), KJG St. Nikolaus, KJG St. Maria Immaculata, DJK Goldbach 1985 e.V., MSC Goldbach, KKS Goldbach, BRK Goldbach, Freiwillige Feuerwehr Goldbach (volunteer fire brigade), RG Goldbach, F.W.V. Goldbach. Economy and infrastructure Transport Goldbach lies right on the A 3 between Frankfurt (roughly 45 km away) and Würzburg (roughly 75 km away). Between Goldbach and Hösbach, when the Autobahn was being widened to six lanes, a “housing” was built over the roadway to reduce the noise pollution. Public institutions On the way out of the community, going towards Unterafferbach, is a forest swimming pool. The indoor swimming pool at the elementary school is open to the public in the winter months. Throughout the community are 10 playgrounds, 3 football pitches and 2 sport halls.

{"text": "Cordignano is a town and comune with 7,020 inhabitants in the province of Treviso, Veneto, Italy. Morphology of the territory Located on the border between Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia (province of Pordenone), the municipality of Cordignano covers a considerable portion of the territory, elevation varying between above sea level, extending from the plateau to the plains below Cansiglio, to the north of road SS 13. Element that strongly characterizes the region is the presence of Meschio River, which runs through the town, coming from Vittorio Veneto. History The first inhabited center of the territory of the municipality dates back to prehistoric times. It then traces of a fort (known as Castelat) dated between the 14th and 10th centuries BC, in the north, at the Alpine foothills of Belluno. In Roman times the area continued to grow mainly in the agricultural field, forming an active farming community still witnessed in the Middle Ages. It was in this period that the center took on the name Corticionus (hence Cordignano). In the 13th century it became the curia of Da Camino, then between the 15th and 18th century it was a fief of the Rangoni family of Modena, passing in the 18th century to the branch of the Mocenigo family in Venice with residence at San Stae. In the 20th century Cordignano should be remembered for the development of the craft industry, and then the industry, still thriving today, in part by changing the orientation of agricultural previous centuries and behaving even a redesign of the territory, with vast industrial zones and new infrastructure. Places of interest Religious buildings Churches The different centers that draw the municipal area, mostly of rural origin, find their center in the ancient religious buildings are listed below those of historical and architectural importance: The Church of Saint Maria Assunta and Cassiano del Meschio is the church of Cordignano center, the hub of the city. It was built in the 17th century, stands on the foundations of ancient buildings dating back to the pre-existing Roman and medieval times; the current building has a gabled façade divided into three by pairs of Ionic pilasters, terminating in a pediment surmounted by jagged and three sculptures. Internally it contains artistic works by Palma il Giovane, Giovanni De Min, Marco Domenico Tintoretto and Marco Vecellio. It is also characterized by the presence, on the left side of a tall bell tower of the 20th century. St. Stephen's Church is the parish church of the frazione Pinidello important for the cycle of frescoes of the interior, attributed to Francesco Del Zotto. Church of San Zeno is the ancient church (13th century), of the frazione Silvella. Church of San Valentino church of Ponte della Muda, with a small bell tower and a large stone statue of the patron saint inserted in front, above the stone portal.

{"text": "Leo Baeck College is a privately funded rabbinical seminary and centre for the training of teachers in Jewish education. Based now at the Sternberg Centre, East End Road, Finchley, in the London Borough of Barnet, it was founded by Werner van der Zyl in 1956 and is sponsored by The Movement for Reform Judaism, Liberal Judaism and the United Jewish Israel Appeal. It is named after the inspirational 20th-century German Liberal rabbi Leo Baeck. Rabbinic ordinations from Leo Baeck College are recognised worldwide by the Liberal, Reform and Masorti movements. To date, Leo Baeck College has trained over 170 rabbis, its alumni serving Jewish communities in the United Kingdom and across the world. Leo Baeck College also pioneered the training of rabbis to serve the Jewish communities of the former Soviet Union and has been at the forefront of Jewish-Christian-Muslim dialogue for decades. In addition to the training of rabbis, Leo Baeck College trains teachers, provides an educational consultancy for religion schools and Jewish day schools, supports the development of community leaders, and provides access to Jewish learning for all through interfaith work. History Before Leo Baeck College was founded there was no institution for training Reform rabbis in Britain. All ministers had either received their training in the United States or were graduates of the Orthodox Jews' College who had later switched allegiance and served Reform synagogues. The college was founded in 1956 as the Jewish Theological College of London for the training of Liberal and Reform rabbis and was seen as a successor organisation to the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums in Berlin and the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau. It was renamed Leo Baeck College shortly afterwards at van der Zyl's suggestion in honour of his teacher, Dr Leo Baeck, the inspirational 20th-century German Liberal rabbi. Location The college was originally housed at West London Synagogue and expanded into a new building at the West London Synagogue site in 1963. It moved in 1981 to larger premises at the Manor House (later known as The Sternberg Centre) in North Finchley, along with other institutions within the progressive Jewish movements. This in turn led to a major growth in its activities, especially its extramural department, which provided a wide range of day-time and evening activities for the wider public. Its teachers training department also expanded and eventually formed a separate education department that served both the Reform and Liberal movements, later being known as the Centre for Jewish Education (CJE). In 2001 CJE integrated with the old Leo Baeck College to become Leo Baeck College–Centre for Jewish Education (LBC-CJE). Alumni The college's first two students were Lionel Blue and Michael Leigh, both of whom became distinguished rabbis. Female students had been admitted from the outset, although none graduated as rabbis until Jacqueline Tabick in 1975.<ref name=\"Tabick\">{{cite book | title=\"I Never Really Wanted To Be First\" in Hear Our Voice, Sybil Sheridan (ed.) | publisher=SCM Press | author=Jacqueline Tabick| year=1994 | location=Norwich| title-link=Sybil Sheridan }}</ref> Among Leo Baeck's other alumni are: Rabbi Tony Bayfield; Rabbi Pauline Bebe, the first woman rabbi in France; Rabbi Harry Jacobi; Rabbi Maurice Michaels, Jewish chaplain to the London 2012 Olympic Games; Rabbi Baroness Neuberger; Rabbi Jonathan Romain; Rabbi Elizabeth Tikvah Sarah; Rabbi Sybil Sheridan; Rabbi Jackie Tabick, the first female rabbi to be trained in the United Kingdom; and Rabbi Alexandra Wright, the first female senior rabbi in England. Staff In the first few years almost all the faculty members were refugees from Nazism. Van der Zyl's work was furthered by many others, including Rabbis Hugo Gryn and John D Rayner, who jointly supervised the college's affairs after his retirement. In 1972 Rabbi Albert Friedlander became Director and during his tenure the student body grew in size. Faculty members have also included Rabbi Louis Jacobs and Karen Armstrong. In 1985 Rabbi Professor Jonathan Magonet became the first full-time Principal, a position he held for 20 years, retiring in 2005. He was succeeded by Rabbi Professor Marc Saperstein in the following year, when the combined new college adopted the name Leo Baeck College. Saperstein completed his term of office in July 2011 and continues to teach at the college as Professor of Jewish History and Homiletics. The current Principal (since September 2011) is Rabbi Deborah Kahn-Harris, a graduate of Leo Baeck College and one of the first woman rabbis to lead a mainstream rabbinic seminary. Library The college's library has 60,000 books, including donations of books from the former Hochschule library and many rare editions. Courses Throughout its history, Leo Baeck College has had a number of collaborations with different academic bodies. Its awards have been validated amongst others by the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA), the Open University Validation Services (OUVS), the Institute of Education (IOE) and the University of Winchester (UoW). From 2015 to 2016 Leo Baeck College formed a new partnership arrangement with Middlesex University which validates all the Jewish Studies and Jewish Education awards, with the exception of the research awards. The degrees carry the imprimatur of Middlesex University.

{"text": "Uttar Pradesh is India's fourth largest state by land area, and most populous state, located in the north-central part of the country. It spreads over a large area, and the plains of the state are quite distinctly different from the high mountains in the north. The climate of this state can also vary widely - primarily due to it being far from the moderating effect of the sea and the occasional cold air arising due to western disturbances. Location Uttar Pradesh is bounded by Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh on the north-west, Haryana and Delhi on the west, Rajasthan on the south-west, Madhya Pradesh on the south, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand on south-east and Bihar on the east. Situated between 23°52'N and 31°28'N latitudes and 77°3'E and 84°39'E longitudes, this is the fourth largest state in the country in terms of area, and the first in terms of population. Uttar Pradesh can be divided into four distinct hypsographical regions : The Shivalik foothills Terai in the North The Gangetic Plain in the centre - Highly fertile alluvial soils; flat topography broken by numerous ponds, lakes, and rivers; slope 2 m/km The Vindhya Hills and plateau in the south - Hard rock Strata; varied topography of mountains, hills, plains, valleys, and plateau; limited water availability. The Shivalik Range which forms the southern foothills of the Himalayas, slopes down into a boulder bed called Bhabar. The transitional belt running along the entire length of the state is called the Terai and Bhabar area. It has rich forests, cutting across it are innumerable streams that swell into raging torrents during the monsoon. The Bhabar tract gives place to the terai area which is covered with tall elephant grass and thick forests interspersed with marshes and swamps. The sluggish rivers of the Bhabar deepen in this area, their course running through a tangled mass of thick undergrowth. The terai runs parallel to the Bhabar in a thin strip. The main crops are wheat, rice, and sugar cane. Jute also is grown. The most important area for the economy of the state is the Gangetic plain which stretches across the entire length of the state from east to west. The entire alluvial plain can be divided into three sub-regions. The first is the eastern tract consisting of 14 districts which are subject to periodical floods and droughts and have been classified as scarcity areas. These districts have the highest density of population which gives the lowest per capita land. The other two regions, the central and the western are comparatively better with a well-developed irrigation system. They suffer from waterlogging and large-scale user tracts. The Gangetic plain is watered by the Yamuna, the Ganges and its major tributaries, the Ramganga, the Gomati, the Ghaghra and Gandak. The whole plain is alluvial and very fertile. The chief crops cultivated here are rice, wheat, pearl millet, gram, and barley. Sugar cane is the chief cash crop of the region. • The southern fringe of the Gangetic is demarcated by the Vindhya Hills and plateau. It comprises the four districts of Jhansi, Jalaun, Banda, and Hamirpur in Bundelkhand division, Meja and Karchhana tehsils of Allahabad district, the whole of Mirzapur district south of Ganges and Chakia tehsil of Chandauli district. The ground is strong with low hills. The Betwa and Ken rivers join the Yamuna from the south-west in this region. It has four distinct kinds of soil, two of which are agriculturally difficult to manage. They are black cotton soil. Rainfall is scanty and erratic and water-resources are scarce. Dry farming is practical on a large scale. Climate The climate of the state is tropical monsoon. The average temperature varies in the plains from 3 to 4 °C in January to 43 to 45 °C in May and June. There are three distinct seasons - winter from October to February, summer from March to mid-June, and the rainy season from June to September. The rainfall in the plains is heaviest in the east and decreases towards the north-west. Floods are a recurring problem in the state, causing damage to crops, life, and property. The worst floods were in 1971, when 51 of the 54 districts of the state were affected — an area of nearly 52,000 square kilometres. The eastern districts are the most vulnerable to floods, the western districts slightly less and the central region markedly less. The eastern districts susceptibility to floods is ascribed, among other things, to heavy rainfall, low flat country, high subsoil water level and the silting of beds which causes river levels to rise. The problem in the western districts is mainly poor drainage caused by the obstruction of roads, railways, canals, new built-up areas etc. There is water logging in large areas. The major flood-prone rivers are the Ganga, Yamuna, Gomti, Ghaghara, Rapti, Sharda and Ramganga. The inadequate drainage capacity of the smaller western Sirsa, Kali and the Aligarh drain is also a cause of floods. Flora and fauna Recorded Forest Area constitute about 6.88% of the total geographical area of the state and Total Forest and Tree cover is 9.01% of total geographical area. The Terai and Bhabar area in the Gangetic Plain have most of the forests. The Vindhyan forests consists mostly of scrub. The districts of Jaunpur, Ghazipur and Ballia have no forest land, while 31 other districts have less forest area. Forests The existing flora in Uttar Pradesh can be classified into three categories- Wet tropical deciduous forests. Dry tropical deciduous forests. Tropical thorny forests. On the Shivalik foothills and in the terai-bhabhar area grow the sal and gigantic haldu. Along river courses the shisham grows in abundance. The Vindhyan forests have dhak, teak, mahua, salai, chironji and tendu. Sisso is mostly used for furniture while khair yields kattha, which is taken with betel leaves or pan. Semal and gutel are used as matchwood and kanju in the plywood industry. Babul provides the principal tanning material of the state. Some of the grasses such as baib and bamboo are raw material for the paper industry. Tendu leaves are used in making bidis (Indian cigarettes), and cane is used in baskets and furniture. Species of grasses have been collected from the Gangetic plain. Herbs include medicinal plants like Rauvolfia serpentina, Viala serpens, podophyllum, hexandrum and Ephecra gerardiana. Animal life Corresponding to its variegated topography and climate, the state has a wealth of animal life. Its avifauna is among the richest in the country. Animals that can be found in the jungles of Uttar Pradesh include the tiger, leopard, wild bear, sloth bear, chital, sambhar, golden jackal, porcupine, jungle cat, hare, squirrel, monitor lizards, and fox. The most common birds include the crow, pigeon, dove, jungle fowl, black partridge, house sparrow, peafowl, blue jay, parakeet, kite, mynah, quail, bulbul, kingfisher and woodpecker. Certain species are found in special habitats. The elephant is confined to the terai and the foothills. The gond and para also found in this region. The chinkara and the sandgrouse prefer a dry climate, and are native to the Vindhyan forests. Among the game birds resident in the state are the snipe, comb duck, grey duck, cotton teal and whistling teal. Several species of wildlife have become extinct in Uttar Pradesh. Among them are the lion from the Gangetic plain and the rhinoceros from the terai. The fate of many species is uncertain, including the tiger, black buck, serow, swamp deer, bustard, pink-headed duck, and mural pheasants and four-horned antelope. Although determined enforcement of laws against poaching and hunting has yielded some results, the wildlife population today is alarmingly low. Gharials are poached for their skin. To preserve its wildlife the state has established one National Park; Dudhwa National Park and 12 game sanctuaries..

{"text": "Ten Bears (Comanche: Pawʉʉrasʉmʉnurʉ) ( - November 23, 1872) was the principal chief of the Yamparika or \"Root Eater\" division of the Comanche from ca. 1860-72. He was the leader of the Ketahto (\"The Barefeet\") local group of the Yamparika, probably from the late 1840s. The ethnonym (group name), Yamparika or \"Root Eater\" Comanche was known to the Spaniards of New Mexico as early as the 1750s, but until about 1790, they were generally north of the Arkansas River and so were seldom specifically mentioned in Spanish documents. After that time, with the advance of Cheyennes (Comanche: paka naboo 'striped arrows'), and Cuampes, likely Arapahos, some Yamparika local groups, including the Ketahto, relocated to the valley of the North Canadian River in New Mexico and Texas. Early life Ten Bears was orphaned as a baby when his family group was murdered by Lakotas. Later Comanche oral history states that in his young adult years, he was noted for leading horse-mounted spear attacks on Lakota villages. Rise to political prominence Ten Bears was a key figure in making peace between the Comanches and the Utes in 1820. Ten Bears was often in rivalry with a man named either Isakwahip 'Wolf's Back', or Isakiip 'Wolf's Elbow', leader of another local group in the North Canadian valley. In 1840 the Yamparika chief, Ten Bears, was one among the principal promoters (together with the Kiowa chiefs Dohasan and Satank and the Arapaho Hosa Little Raven) of the peace and large alliance between the Comanche and Kiowa alliance and the Cheyenne and Arapaho alliance after the Cheyenne and Arapaho's victory at Wolf Creek during the spring 1838. To reach his purpose, Ten Bears (Parrawasamen) was able to gain the approval of such chiefs as the Kotsoteka Shaved Head (Wulea-boo) and, even through Shaved Head’s support, Big Eagle (a.k.a. Sun Eagle) (Tawaquenah), likely the Nokoni Tall Tree (Huupi-pahati) and certainly the Penateka Buffalo Hump (Pocheha-quehip, Potsʉnakwahipʉ) and Yellow Wolf (Isaviah) and probably the Kwahadi Iron Jacket (Pohebits-quasho); together with Ten Bears (Parrawasamen), probably Tawaquenah and Huupi-pahati, certainly Buffalo Hump (Pocheha-quehip) and eventually Iron Jacket (Pohebits-quasho) represented Comanche nation during the negotiation near the Two Butte Creek, resulting in a peace agreement and a strong alliance between the two groups. Ten Bears first came to the attention of Anglo-Americans in 1853 when he, among others, signed the Treaty of Fort Atkinson. His name was written as \"Parosawano\" and translated as 'Ten Sticks', a confusion of /pawʉʉra/ 'bear' with /paria/ 'dogwood stick'. The error was corrected in the 1854 revision of the treaty. Ten Bears became the principal Yamparika chief about 1860 after the death of the man known to Anglos as 'Shaved Head' (Wulea-boo, possibly a Kotsoteka rather than a Yamparika Comanche); the latter's Comanche name is uncertain as there were several men whom Anglos called by that name. In August 1861 Ten Bears (likely being himself the chief named as “Bistevana”) signed the Fort Cobb Treaty with gen. Albert Pike, the Confederate Indian Commissioner, sanctioning an alliance with the “Gray Jackets”. In 1863, along with a delegation of Western Indians, including Southern Cheyennes, Southern Arapahoes, and Kiowas, Ten Bears visited Washington, but he was unable to get any major concessions for his people from the U.S. government. In November 1864, Ten Bears was the chief of the Yamparika Comanches nearest the ruins of the Bent brothers' old adobe trading post (the first Adobe Walls, Texas, built ca 1840) when troops under Col. Christopher 'Kit' Carson attacked a nearby Kiowa village . Warriors from Ten Bear's village led the counterattack which drove off Carson's men, although one of Ten Bears' sons, Ekamoksu 'Red Sleeve' was killed. Treaty of the Little Arkansas River In 1865, Ten Bears and two of his sons, Isananaka 'Wolf's Name' and Hitetetsi 'Little Crow', along with other Comanches, mostly Yamparikas, signed the Treaty of the Little Arkansas River in Kansas. The treaty created a reservation for the Comanches encompassing the entire panhandle of Texas. This was problematic, as the Federal government did not then \"own\" that territory and therefore could not reserve it: the Republic of Texas was annexed to the United States in 1849, but the Republic did not recognize any native land claims within its borders — this opinion was based on a faulty reading of Spanish and Mexican law and therefore in 1865 there were no \"federal\" versus \"state\" owned lands within the boundaries of Texas which the Government could \"reserve\" to the Native Americans. Medicine Lodge Treaty Two years later, at the October 1867 Medicine Lodge Treaty Conference, Ten Bears and other Yamparikas as well as a few other Comanches (but none of the newly emergent Kwahada division, who were delayed by sickness), agreed to a smaller reservation in western Indian territory of Oklahoma. At that conference, Ten Bears gave an eloquent address: Death A year later in December 1868, a number of Yamparika local bands, including Ten Bear's, were along the Washita River in western Indian Territory, near their allied Cheyennes and within the boundaries of the latter's reservation. When troops under Lt. Col George Armstrong Custer attacked the Cheyenne village under Black Kettle, Yamparika warriors from the village of Esarosavit 'White Wolf' joined in the counter attack, and \"rode over\" the detachment of Major Joel Elliot. In 1872, Ten Bears again visited Washington, along with a delegation that included his grandson Cheevers (probably from the Spanish chiva 'goat', although Attocknie argues that it was tsii putsi 'little pitied one'), as well as other Comanches and Kiowas. But the hope that promises would be kept was ultimately futile. Ten Bears died soon after his return, November 23, 1872, at Fort Sill where he is buried. In Popular Media Ten Bears, played by the Muscogee actor Will Sampson, is portrayed in the film The Outlaw Josey Wales as a Comanche chief defending his home who then makes a \"live and let live\" peace with the title character, portrayed by Clint Eastwood.

He enjoyed a lengthy career, playing primarily as a defensive midfielder for Italian clubs Torino, Saviglianese, Fiorentina, Sampdoria, and Piacenza. Due to his tactical intelligence, passing, stamina, tenacity, and versatility, he was capable of playing in several midfield and defensive positions. At international level, he represented Italy on three occasions between 1998 and 1999, and was member of the team that took part at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Club career Cois was born in Fossano. He played for several clubs throughout his career, including Torino (1988–1994), Sampdoria (2002–03) and Piacenza (2003). He achieved notable success with Torino early in his career, after achieving Serie A promotion by winning the 1989–90 Serie B title with the club. He later won the Mitropa Cup in 1991, the Coppa Italia in 1993, and he helped his team to the 1991–92 UEFA Cup final, after helping his team to qualify for the tournament by leading them to a third place in Serie A in 1991. In the 1992 UEFA Cup Final, they were defeated by Ajax on aggregate. Cois is perhaps best known for his spell at Fiorentina (1994–2002) in the mid-late 90s where he won over the fans with his tireless running and tenacious play, becoming important to the side as the less glamorous foil to playmakers like Rui Costa and Domenico Morfeo. With the club he won two Coppa Italia trophies in 1996 and 2001, and a Supercoppa Italiana in 1996, also helping Fiorentina to two third-place finishes in Serie A in 1996 and 1999. International career It was during his period with Fiorentina in the late 90s that Cois broke into the Italy national football team. He was a participant at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, although he never became a regular in the side, winning just 3 caps between 1998 and 1999, one of which was in an unofficial match against the FIFA World Stars, also failing to make an appearance at the 1998 World Cup.

{"text": "Southern Electric plc was a public limited energy company in the United Kingdom between 1990 and 1998, when it merged with Scottish Hydro-Electric plc to form Scottish and Southern Energy plc (now SSE plc). The company had its origins in the southern England region of the British nationalised electricity industry. Created in 1948 as the Southern Electricity Board, in 1990 it was privatised by being floated on the London Stock Exchange. History The company originated as the Southern Electricity Board, created in 1948 as part of the nationalisation of the electricity industry by the Electricity Act 1947. The board's assets passed in 1990 to Southern Electric plc, one of the fourteen public electricity suppliers, and that company was privatised in the same year. In 1998 the company merged with Scottish Hydro-Electric plc and became part of Scottish and Southern Energy.

{"text": "Erlenbach am Main (officially: Erlenbach a.Main) is the largest town in the Miltenberg district in the Regierungsbezirk of Lower Franconia (Unterfranken) in Bavaria, Germany. It has a population of around 10,000. Erlenbach is the site of one of the Miltenberg district's two hospitals, and is well known for its wine. Until 25 years ago, Erlenbach was Bavaria's newest town. Geography Location Erlenbach lies in Lower Franconia in Bavaria's northwest, at the Mainviereck (“Main Square”), near Aschaffenburg. Constituent communities The formerly self-administering neighbouring communities of Mechenhard and Streit were amalgamated with Erlenbach in 1976 and 1978, respectively. History The local area has been inhabited at least since the late Bronze Age, based on archaeological findings. In 1876, four barrows from the Bronze Age (roughly 1550–1250 BC) were discovered. In 1981, two typical Urnfield culture graves from the time about 1000–800 BC were found. In the 1st century AD, the Roman Empire reached all the way to the Main. This watery stretch of the Limes Germanicus was enforced with castra. To avoid the Romans, the Germanic peoples moved their settlements to the other side of the Main, the east side, or right bank. After the Roman Empire fell, it took many years for the Franks to move into the Main region in 531 and found settlements of their own. The first farms in Erlenbach were likely only built sometime between 800 and 950. About 1183, Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa granted Erlenbach market rights. The Imperial award was given visible expression with a market and freedom sign. It shows a large cross on whose top stands a cock. On the crossbeam a hand rises up on one side and on the other a sword. The upheld hand made clear that the Erlenbach dwellers stood under the Emperor's special protection, and that any who set himself against it would have to reckon with the sovereign's upraised sword. Demographics Religion Besides the Catholic churches Saint Peter's and Saint Paul's, Saint Joseph’s (main town), Saint Joseph’s (outlying centre of Mechenhard) and Saint Charles Borromeo’s there is also the Evangelical Martin Luther Church. Since January 2007 there has also been the Evangelical Free Church Erlenbach Congregation, which in April 2009 counted 61 members. Economy Since 1918, Erlenbach has been the site of a shipyard that as of 2003 was \"one of the largest inland vessel yards\" in Europe. Governance Town council The council is made up of 24 council members, with seats apportioned thus: CSU 10 SPD 7 Bündnis 90/Die Grünen 5 Freie Wähler 2 Mayors The Mayor is Christoph Becker (CSU), and the deputies are Alexander Monert (CSU) and Jörg Barth (Freie Wähler). Town twinning Saint-Maurice, Val-de-Marne, France Erlenbach, Canton of Zürich, Switzerland Erlenbach im Simmental, Canton of Bern, Switzerland Coat of arms The town's arms might be described thus: Or an eagle with two heads displayed sable crowned on each head gules with studs of the field, armed and beaked of the field holding in his talon dexter an orb of the third banded and ensigned with a cross of the field and in his talon sinister a sword of the third, in chief an Elector's crown proper. This coat of arms, newly conferred upon the market community of Erlenbach am Main in 1953 is based on two seals known to have been borne by the Erlenbach court in the time from 1722 to 1810 and whose images matched each other. Both seals showed a crowned two-headed eagle holding a monarch's orb in the right talon and a sword in the left. Floating above the eagle's heads was an Elector's crown, and underneath their heads were the letters E and B (Erlenbach). Culture and sightseeing The renovated Frankenhalle offers theatre, musicals and concerts. The Kino-Passage cinema has operated since 1979 as a repertory cinema. There are also many festivals and markets. Winegrowing is only confirmed as a local practice by a document from 2 January 1261. Since 1990, Erlenbach has been located on the Fränkischer Rotwein Wanderweg (\"Franconian Red Wine Hiking Trail\"), a along-distance hiking path. Sports The town's association football club SV Erlenbach, formed in 1919, experienced its greatest success in 2013 when it won promotion to the Bayernliga for the first time.

{"text": "The Norwegian Order of Freemasons (Norwegian: Den Norske Frimurerorden) is the Masonic Grand Lodge in Norway. The first lodge (St. Olai Lodge - Later changed to Lodge St. Olaus to the white Leopard) was opened in 1749 and is still working. The Grand Lodge has followed the Swedish Rite since 1818, which requires its members to adhere to Christianity. During the union of Sweden-Norway, the Swedish-Norwegian king was Grand Master of the Order. The sovereign Grand Lodge of Norway was consecrated in 1891. As of 2009, the Order has about 20,000 members. The Order consists of 63 lodges of St. John (Iº – IIIº), 19 lodges of St. Andrew (IVº – VIº), three Steward lodges of 2. order (VII º), four Steward lodges of 1. order (VIIº – VIIIº), three Provincial lodges (VIIº – Xº), the Grand lodge (VIIº – XIIº) and one research lodge. The order is headquartered in Oslo, with a large building next to the Norwegian Parliament. Founding lodges of the order Lodge St. Olaus to the white leopard Lodge St. Olaus to the white leopard (Danish: St. Olaus til den hvide leopard) was established on June 24, 1749 on the island of Ladegaard, in the building of Bygdøy Kongsgaard in Christiania. The original name of the lodge was St. Olai, and it was named after the Norwegian king Olaf the Holy one (Olai is a Latin genitive form of Olav). In 1780 the lodge changed its name to Saint Olaus to the white leopard. In 1785, the second City Hall of Christiana (built 1733) was bought by St. Olai Lodge. The inauguration of the lodge rooms was carried out by Bernt Anker, and the lodge had its residence in the ground floor and the first floor until 1811. Today, the lodge resides inside the headquarters of the Norwegian Order of Freemasons in Nedre Vollgt. 19, Oslo, as a neighbour building of the Norwegian Storting. The coat of arms of the Lodge carries the Latin inscription Artis Ope Ferociam Exuit, meaning \"With the help of the Art, it (the leopard) shall get rid of its wildness (or rage).\" St. Olai Lodge was the first Masonic lodge in Norway, and the mother lodge of many lodges in the Norwegian Order of Freemasons. It was founded by Count Christian Conrad Danneskiold-Laurvig, probably with the Danish king Frederick V of Denmark present at the initiation ceremony. The lodge is an offshoot of the Danish lodge St. Martin which existed in Copenhagen from 1743 to 1767. Nationality The lodge received its directives from Danish Freemasonic lodges from 1749 to 1818. Its first mother lodge was «St. Martin», founded in Copenhagen in 1743. In 1745, the lodge «Zorobabel», also in Copenhagen, was founded as an offshoot of «St. Martin», with a Patent from the Premier Grand Lodge of England dated 25 October 1745. The two lodges «St. Martin» and «Zorobabel» was unified into the new lodge «Zorobabel to the Northern Star» on 9 January 1767, upon which the new lodge became the new directing lodge of St. Olaus. In 1818, due to the union between Norway and Sweden, the lodge St. Olaus to the white leopard became a member of The Swedish Order of Freemasons. The lodge was one of the six founding members of the Norwegian Order of Freemasons («Province X») on 24 June 1891. Rites On its foundations in 1749, St Olaus was a pure lodge of St. John, a «blue lodge» practising the Craft degrees. In 1752 the lodge also gradually began to practise the high degrees of Rite of Strict Observance. The establishment of the rites was finished in 1762 and was practised in cooperation with the Copenhagen-lodges until 1782. The rectified rite was introduced in Denmark and Norway in 1782. It was influenced by French Freemasonry and was less concerned with Christian institutions. Among other things, it removed the legend about the Knights Templars from the teachings. In 1818, St. Olaus became directed from the Swedish Grand lodge, and in 1819 it was transformed into a «blue lodge» of St. John practising the three Craft degrees since then. St. Andrew lodge Oscar to the burning star The St. Andrew lodge Oscar to the burning star (Norwegian: Oscar til den flammende Stjerne) sometimes known as Lodge of St. Andrew no. 1, was founded in Drammen in 1826 as a Craft lodge, practising the three degrees of St. John. After having delivered an application to the Swedish Grand Lodge, it was moved to Christiana and elevated to a St. Andrew lodge practising the Scottish degrees of St. Andrew (IV°-VI°) of the Swedish Rite. The Act of capitulation as a lodge of St. John was formulated on 10 April 1836. Its constituting patent as a lodge of St. Andrew was then worked out on 10 April 1841.

{"text": "The J-class yacht Velsheda was designed by Charles Ernest Nicholson and built in 1933 by Camper and Nicholsons at Gosport, Hampshire. She was built for businessman William Lawrence Stephenson and between 1933 and 1936, she won many races and competed with other yachts of her era such as Britannia, Endeavour and Shamrock V. History Initial career Designed by Charles Ernest Nicholson and built by Camper & Nicholsons in 1933 for Mr W.L. Stephenson, managing director of Woolworth retail shops, she was built in 1933 at Gosport. She was Nicholson's second design for a J Class and Stephenson's second big yacht. Velsheda was named after Stephenson's three daughters, Velma, Sheila and Daphne. She raced with the greatest names in classic yachting including Britannia, Endeavour and Shamrock V between 1933 and 1936. In her second season she won more than 40 races and achieved an outstanding record of success at regattas from Southend to Dartmouth. Other venues included Torbay, Swanage and of course the Solent, all under the control of the very famous Captain Fred Mountifield. The permanent racing crew at that time was probably around 16 men and this would have been augmented to around 30 for racing. When not required for sail changes, spare crew were moved to below decks. In her 1930s heyday, she represented the most advanced technical design for spars, rigging, sails, deck gear and ropes. Her masts were aluminium, made by bending plates and riveting them together. Sails were made from the new Terylene threads and deck gear now included winches for easier handling of sheets. The standing rigging was solid rod, even in the 1930s, but with so much stretch in the rigging and systems it was inevitable that J Class masts could not be held in column and would collapse in stronger winds. In anything above a force 3, there was serious concern about holding the rig in place without collapse. Below decks accommodation was limited to just the main saloon, owners quarters aft, and storage for sails and equipment forward. By 1937 she was laid up in a mud berth on the River Hamble and became derelict. Many sailors remember visiting her - one recalls sailing in the annual Warming Pan race at Hamble, and all the visiting crew being taken up the river to their overnight accommodation on Velsheda. Subsequent restoration Velsheda was rescued from her Hamble mud berth in 1984 by Terry Brabant, who economically refitted her for charter work with a new steel mast and limited interior. Work was carried out by a traditional boat builder Christopher Peterson and a big team of workers. Still without an engine she sailed regularly along the UK south coast on charter work and occasionally ventured to the Mediterranean and Caribbean. She had a chequered career: whilst on charter during the early 1990s Velsheda visited the UK east coast where she found herself on the beach on a falling tide; fortunately she was recovered safely. Occasionally she raced in the annual Round the Island Race and although in poor condition, she was still an impressive sight, competing the 60 mile course in quick time. She was laid up and moored at Gosport in 1995/6. She was purchased in 1996 as a bare hull from the bankrupt C & N yard in Portsmouth Harbour. Southampton Yacht Services on the River Itchen were then commissioned to undertake a major rebuild including a new one piece carbon fibre mast and inboard diesel engine installation for the first time. She was re-launched in November 1997. Dutch businessman Ronald de Waal (from European retail fashion chain WE, formerly HIJ/HEY/ZIJ) bought Velsheda in 1999 and has campaigned her extensively in the Maxi and classic racing circuits in the Caribbean and in the Mediterranean sea.

{"text": "The Opera House in Quay Street, Manchester, England, is a 1,920-seater commercial touring theatre that plays host to touring musicals, ballet, concerts and a Christmas pantomime. It is a Grade II listed building. The Opera House is one of the main theatres in Manchester. The Opera House and its sister theatre the Palace Theatre on Oxford Street are operated by the same parent company, Ambassador Theatre Group. History The theatre opened as the New Theatre in 1912, renamed the New Queen's Theatre in 1915 and as the Opera House in 1920 when it came under the wing of John Hart and his associates of United Theatres Ltd. In 1931, it was bought by, and prospered under, Howard & Wyndham Ltd which had been formed at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow in 1895 by Michael Simons. The group's managing director A Stewart Cruikshank, headquartered at the group's headquarters in the King's Theatre, Edinburgh, was joined on the board by Charles B Cochrane who now became a visiting producer at the Opera House, premiering numerous musicals and revues. The theatre staged the full range of plays, musicals, opera, and pantomime. It closed in 1979 and for five years was a bingo hall. The Palace Trust acquired it in 1984 and returned it to a theatre. In 1990, it was acquired by Apollo Leisure and staged large-scale musicals. It was subsequently sold to Ambassador Theatre Group in 2009. In March 2020, the theatre acquired Charitable Incorporated Organisation status along with the Palace Theatre. Architecture The theatre has a rectangular plan and is built of stuccoed brick with a slate roof. Its symmetrical fifteen-bay façade is in the classical style with a five-bay centre with fluted Ionic columns. Above the three central bays is a relief of a horse-drawn chariot within a semi-circular arch. The gable has a moulded cornice on brackets. The entrance canopy is a 20th-century addition. The auditorium has two curved cantilevered balconies with large overhangs, each holding 500 seats. Either side of the stage are stacked boxes between pairs of fluted Corinthian columns. The high proscenium arch is decorated with a circular medallion flanked by gryphons. The high ceiling above the auditorium takes the form of a coffered segmental tunnel vault. The stage is deep and wide. The orchestra pit holds 80 musicians. The theatre has 1,920 seats. The theatre was redecorated in March 2011 keeping the green and gold colour scheme of the auditorium unchanged. Notable productions and premieres 1958 – European premiere of West Side Story 1993 to 1995 – British regional premiere of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical The Phantom of the Opera 2005 – Demon Days Live concert by Gorillaz 2011 – World premiere of Ghost The Musical 2012 – UK premiere of Dolly Parton's musical 9 to 5 2017 – World premiere of Bat Out of Hell: The Musical 2017 – World premiere of Take That's musical The Band 2019 – World premiere of & Juliet 2020 – World premiere of Back to the Future: The Musical 2022 – UK premiere of Mrs. Doubtfire See also Listed buildings in Manchester-M3 Live Nation deal – Ambassador Theatre Group's acquisition of venues previously owned by Live Nation UK Palace Theatre References External links Official website Opera House Manchester on ATG Tickets The Opera House, Quay Street, Manchester on Arthur Lloyd.co.uk Independent guide Theatres in Manchester Theatres completed in 1912 Grade II listed buildings in Manchester 1912 establishments in England"}
{"text": "Francesco \"Checco\" Moriero (; born 31 March 1969) is an Italian football former player and current manager, who played as a midfielder, usually as a winger on the right flank. He is the current head coach of the Maldives national football team. Throughout his career, he played for several Italian clubs: Lecce, Cagliari, Roma, Inter Milan, and Napoli, winning an UEFA Cup title with Inter in 1998. A former Italy international, he took part at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Club career Francesco Moriero played for several Italian clubs throughout his career, including Lecce (1986–1992), Cagliari (1992–94), Roma (1994–97), Inter Milan (1997–2000), and Napoli (2000–2002). Originally from Lecce, he began his career with the local club's youth side, making his professional debut with the senior Lecce side during the 1986–87 Serie B season. The following season, he made 35 appearances, scoring 3 goals, helping the team to gain promotion to Serie A. He played two seasons in Serie A with Lecce, making 86 appearances and scoring 4 goals, before Lecce were relegated to Serie B once again. During the 1991–92 Serie B season, he set a personal best of 6 goals in 34 appearances, before moving to Cagliari in 1992, where he made his debut in European competitions, notably helping the team to reach the semi-final of the 1993–94 UEFA Cup. In 1994, he moved to Roma for 8.5 billion Lit. He spent 3 seasons with the club, becoming an important figure, making 75 appearances in Serie A, and scoring 8 goals. In May 1997, he had initially made a deal to sign for Milan, but in July, he signed with Inter for 1 million Lit. in an exchange between the two Milan clubs involving André Cruz, who was initially about to sign a contract with Inter. He made his debut with Inter on the first matchday of the 1997–98 Serie A season, on 31 August 1997, against Brescia, at the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium. His most notable and successful career spell came with the Milan club, and in his first season, he won the 1997–98 UEFA Cup under manager Luigi Simoni, notably scoring a goal from a bicycle kick against the Swiss team Neuchatel Xamax during the tournament. In the final he also set up Ronaldo's goal shortly after coming on as a substitute. Inter also narrowly missed out on the Serie A title to Juventus that season, as Moriero made 28 league appearances that season, scoring 3 goals. Although he made fewer appearances during the next two seasons due to injury (making 28 appearances in Serie A in total, scoring 3 goals), he also later reached the 2000 Coppa Italia final with the club, under Marcello Lippi, before moving to Napoli in 2000. During the 2000–01 Serie A season, he made 14 appearances with Napoli, scoring a goal, although he was unable to save the club from relegation. He ended his career with the club in 2002, in Serie B. In total he made 287 appearances in Serie A, scoring 21 goals. International career After making an appearance with the Italy national under-21 football team in a 1–0 win over Greece on 7 February 1990, under manager Cesare Maldini, Moriero also played for the senior Italy national team; in total, he scored two goals in eight matches for Italy between 1998 and 1999. He made his senior international debut on 28 January 1998, in a 3–0 home win over Slovakia, providing two assists during the match; in his next appearance, in an international friendly against Paraguay on 22 April 1998, he scored his only two goals for Italy, one from a bicycle kick, as they won the match 3–1 at home. Moriero was a participant for Italy at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, under Cesare Maldini once again, where Italy were eliminated in the quarterfinals to hosts and eventual champions France on penalties. Although he was often alternated with the more defensive-minded Angelo Di Livio on the right wing, he still appeared in all five of Italy's matches during the tournament, and he assisted Christian Vieri's first goal in Italy's 3–0 win against Cameroon in their second group stage match, also starting the play for his second goal of the match. He also combined with Filippo Inzaghi to initiate the play which led to Roberto Baggio's match winning goal against Austria in Italy's final group match, as Italy won 2–1 to top their group. He made his final appearance for Italy on 9 October the following year, in a European qualifier against Belarus, under manager Dino Zoff, which ended in a 0–0 away draw. Coaching career In 2006, soon after having successfully ended his studies at the Coverciano football coaching school, Moriero was appointed head coach of Ivorian club Africa Sports. On 27 July 2007, Africa Sports announced that they have sacked Moriero, appointing his assistant Salvatore Nobile as new boss. On 7 August, Moriero signed for Serie C1's Lanciano, guiding the club under massive financial issues that successively led to bankrupt, an auction-regulated sale and point deductions throughout the season. He successively guided F.C. Crotone to win the Lega Pro Prima Divisione playoffs and achieve promotion to Serie B in the 2008–09 season. He then served as head coach of Serie B club Frosinone from July 2009 to April 2010. In September 2010 he was named new head coach of Grosseto in the Italian Serie B, replacing Luigi Apolloni, but was dismissed later in January 2011 due to poor results. In the season 2012–13 he was again named head coach of Grosseto, but on 1 October 2012 he was sacked. On 30 June 2013, Moriero signed with his former club, Lecce, although he was dismissed 24 September. On 1 July 2014, he was hired by Catanzaro, although he was later sacked once again by the club on 9 November. In May 2017 he was appointed coach of Sambenedettese. He was fired in November, but was later called back in April 2018. He left the club again on 30 June 2018. In June 2019 he joined Cavese, but was fired in September after 4 Serie C matches without wins. On 30 December 2020, he was announced as the new head coach of Albanian club Dinamo Tirana, with Fabrizio Miccoli as his assistant. On 2 March 2021, both Moriero and Miccoli resigned from their coaching roles at the club, after having been in charge of only two league games for the Albanian club. On 21 October 2021, Moriero was unveiled as the new head coach of the Maldives national football team on a two-year deal; his appointment made Moriero the first ever coach from a World Cup winning country to coach the Maldives in the history. Style of play Moriero was a right-footed, quick, diminutive, energetic, and highly technical midfielder, who was predominantly used as right winger; although he was primarily an offensive minded player, with a penchant for making attacking runs, and who was even used as an outside forward on occasion, he was also known for his work-rate, tactical intelligence, and defensive contribution off the ball, as well as his ability to track back, which enabled him to cover the flank effectively. Moriero's main attributes were his acceleration, pace, dribbling skills, agility, flair, and creativity; these characteristics enabled him to beat opponents in one on one situations, get up the wing, and provide width to his team by overloading the flanks, giving his team a numerical advantage when attacking. He was also known for his ability to create chances and provide assists for strikers with his crossing ability and long balls from the right flank. He also had good vision and distribution, as well as a penchant for scoring with spectacular strikes from distance, or acrobatic goals from volleys and bicycle kicks. Regarded as one of the best wingers of his generation, during his prime, his world class performances, characteristics, playing style, and position on the pitch earned him comparisons with esteemed former Italian wingers Franco Causio, Bruno Conti, and Roberto Donadoni, as well as Portuguese winger Luís Figo. However, despite his talent, Moriero also garnered a reputation for being inconsistent at times. In addition to his skills and playing ability, Moriero was also known for his trademark celebration, which involved him pretending to polish his team-mates' football boots whenever they scored a goal.

{"text": "Max Beloff, Baron Beloff, (2 July 1913 – 22 March 1999) was a British historian and Conservative peer. From 1974 to 1979 he was principal of the University College of Buckingham, now the University of Buckingham. Early life Beloff was born on 2 July 1913 at 21 York House, Fieldway Crescent, Islington, London and was the oldest child of a Jewish family who had moved to England in 1903 from Russia. He was the elder son in a family of five children of merchant Semion (Simon) Beloff (born Semion Rubinowicz) and his wife Maria (Marie) Katzin. His sister Anne later married German-born Nobel Prize–winning biochemist Ernst Boris Chain in 1948. His sister Renee Soskin was a politician and educationalist. His other sister Nora Beloff was a journalist and political correspondent. His brother was the psychologist John Beloff. His paternal great-grandmother was Leah Horowitz-Winograd, the sister Eliyahu Shlomo Horowitz-Winograd and a descendant of the Hasidic master, Shmelke Horowitz of Nikolsburg (1726-1778). The young Beloff was educated at St Paul's School, and then studied Modern History at Corpus Christi College, Oxford where he graduated with first-class honours. (Scholar; MA; Honorary Fellow, 1993). Politics In his 1992 autobiographical work A Historian in the Twentieth Century Beloff discusses his political journey. He had been at school a conservative, was then attracted to socialism once at university and became a liberal after the Second World War. In 1962, during public debate of the case for a referendum on whether to join the European Economic Community, he argued that a referendum is not meaningful unless clear alternatives are set before the electorate; in the absence of such clarity, \"the electorate would... be doing no more than indicating a very general bias one way or another\" ('\"The Case against a Referendumˮ\", The Observer, 21 October 1962, p. 11). In the debate about educational standards in the 1960s, he found the Labour government hostile to his idea of a university outside the state-financed framework and felt the Liberal Party was \"moving increasingly to the left\". That inclined him to join the Conservative Party upon his retirement in 1979. He received a knighthood in 1980, and on 26 May 1981 he was created a life peer, taking the title Baron Beloff, of Wolvercote in the County of Oxfordshire. He spoke often on educational and constitutional matters in the House of Lords and, outside of the chamber, continued to write. He was a strong Eurosceptic and argued that Britain's history made it incompatible with membership of the European Union, which led to him writing Britain and European Union: Dialogue of the Deaf, published in 1996. In 1990 Lord Beloff was one of the leading historians behind the setting up of the History Curriculum Association. The Association advocated a more knowledge-based history curriculum in schools. It expressed \"profound disquiet\" at the way history was being taught in the classroom and observed that the integrity of history was threatened. In a House of Lords debate on 21 July 1989 he supported the two Lewes teachers, Chris McGovern and Dr Anthony Freeman who suffered redeployment following their criticism of the academic quality of the what was then the new GCSE examination. He was a strong opponent of New Labour's House of Lords Bill and gave many speeches in the chamber defending the hereditary principle; however, he died before the bill was passed. He gave his final speech in the House of Lords on 22 March 1999, the day he died.

{"text": "Hartley Leroy Alleyne (born 28 February 1957) is a former Barbadian first-class cricketer: a right-handed batsman and right-arm fast bowler who played for Barbados, Worcestershire, Kent and Natal between 1978–79 and 1989–90. He also played club cricket in the Lancashire League, Huddersfield League and the Birmingham League. Alleyne was born at Derricks, St James in 1957. Career Alleyne made his List A debut on 20 March 1979 in a Geddes Grant/Harrison Line Trophy match against the Leeward Islands, claiming the wicket of Test cricketer Derick Parry. Three days later he made his first-class debut against Combined Islands in the Shell Shield, picking up a wicket in each innings. He made no further first-class appearances that season, but did play two more Geddes Grant/Harrison Line Trophy games. Alleyne had played one Minor Counties Championship match in England in 1979, for Lincolnshire against Norfolk, and in 1980 he began to play county cricket for Worcestershire, where he remained for three seasons. He had a fine 1980, capturing 64 first-class wickets at 25.06 and 31 List A wickets at 18.12, as well as scoring what was to be his only first-class half-century – 72 against Lancashire in the only first-class match ever played at Stourport-on-Severn. It was thus little surprise when he was awarded his county cap in 1981, in which year he took a career-best 8–43 against Middlesex. However, in general he failed to reach the same standards as in 1980, and he left the county after the 1982 season. For the next couple of years, Alleyne divided his time between Barbados and Haslingden in the Lancashire League, as well as traveling with a West Indies XI for a non-Test tour of India. He was banned from international cricket after he joined the rebel tour to South Africa in 1983-84, defying the international sporting boycott of the apartheid state. He also played for Buckinghamshire in 1984 and 1985. In 1984/85 he joined Natal, for whom he took 56 first-class and 65 List A wickets in his six seasons there. His second stint in county cricket, with Kent, came in 1988 and 1989, and although he played only nine first-class matches for the county (taking 21 wickets) he did appear 16 times in the one-day game (taking 22). His final first-class outing was for Natal in the Currie Cup against Western Province in October 1989. After that, he played on in the Lancashire League for a couple of seasons, this time for the Colne club. He then became a cricket coach at first Birkenhead Boys School on the Wirral between 2003 and 2006 then St. Edmund's School in Canterbury, Kent, but in 2007 was refused a work permit by the Home Office and threatened with deportation despite having obtained the requested NVQ level 3 in sports coaching. His local MP, Julian Brazier, called the decision \"utter madness\". However, in January 2008 Alleyne was granted leave to remain in the UK for three years, and said that it felt \"like winning the Lotto\".

{"text": "Moira Furnace is a nineteenth-century iron-making blast furnace located in Moira, Leicestershire, on the banks of the Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal. Built by the Earl of Moira in 1804, the building has been preserved by North West Leicestershire District Council as a museum featuring lime kilns and craft workshops. It is a most important industrial monument, since it is remarkably well-preserved, and dates from a formative period of the Industrial Revolution. Description Moira Furnace was a coke-fuelled, steam-engine blown blast furnace for the smelting of iron from local iron ore, with an attached foundry for the manufacture of cast-iron goods. The preserved furnace consists of the blast furnace, the attached bridgehouse, and the loading ramp. The blast furnace is the vertical structure with the blank arches at the lowest part of the site. The furnace within was supplied with raw materials (iron ore, coke, and limestone) by tipping them in through a charging port at the top, accessed from the bridgeloft. The loading ramp, which spans the Ashby Canal, allowed the raw materials to be raised into the bridgeloft, which comprises the top floor of the bridgehouse, the large building with the pitched roof behind the furnace. In the bridgeloft the materials were probably weighed and, maybe, mixed before being charged into the furnace. When the furnace was fired the steam engine blower, now gone, forced a continuous blast of air into the bottom of the furnace in order to make the coke burn brighter and raise the temperature inside high enough to melt the iron (1,538 °C, 2,800 °F). The hot gases exhausted from the low chimney at the top of the furnace. When ready, the molten iron was tapped from the bottom of the furnace and run into moulds to produce pig iron. Moira Furnace is one of the few remaining blast furnaces from this period of innovation - because it was a commercial failure. Had it been successful then it is highly likely that over time the site would have developed and the first furnace replaced. History In 1804, the Earl of Moira had the furnace constructed to take advantage of the iron ore and abundant coal which were present underground in the surrounding Ashby Woulds area owned by him. The location was chosen for its proximity to the Ashby Canal for transport, and the lie of the land which allowed the furnace to be built low down so the raw materials did not need raising very high. However, this was a period of development in blast furnace design and some of the features of Moira Furnace do not appear to have been successful. It was brought into blast in 1806, and used intermittently until 1811, though the foundry remained in use until after 1844 by utilising iron brought in from elsewhere. The historical evidence shows that, although saleable iron was at times produced, over the period that the furnace operated it experienced continual problems. Documents mention bad design, bad construction, bad raw materials, and bad management, but many of the documents were written by individuals trying to divert the blame from themselves. The furnace was abandoned with its final charge still inside, partially smelted. Metallurgical examination has shown a high sulphur content in the raw materials, which may have been a contributory factor, and the chimney shows signs of severe overheating, indicating a design fault or operating problem. The attached foundry continued to be used for some years, using brought-in pig iron, though it was demolished later in the 19th century. Meanwhile the bridgehouse and the engine house, which was a separate building to the side of the furnace, were converted to dwellings and survived. However, by the 1970s they had become derelict and affected by mining subsidence and the engine house was demolished. After pressure by Philip Riden and from Leicestershire Industrial History Society, the furnace and bridgehouse were scheduled as an ancient monument. The site was acquired by North West Leicestershire District Council in 1981, who sponsored a Community Programme to restore the site and develop it as a museum and country park. Inside the bridgehouse there is now a museum, operated by the Moira Furnace Museum Trust, which is open regularly. It has information boards and displays about Moira Furnace and the industrial heritage of the area. The furnace has become a popular site for the detection of paranormal activity by Swadlincote Paranormal Investigations, who first visited the furnace with Richard Felix and Phil Whyman. They hold nocturnal events here, which are open to the public.

{"text": "The 171st Special Operations Aviation Squadron (171 SOAS) is an Australian Army helicopter squadron that provides aviation support to the Special Operations Command. The squadron is being equipped with the UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter. The squadron is based at Luscombe Airfield, Holsworthy Barracks, Sydney and forms part of the 6th Aviation Regiment as the regiment's sole operational squadron. Overview The squadron primarily supports the Tactical Assault Group, troop lift support is also provided to other Special Forces based at Holsworthy and Perth, and to other east coast and southern Australian based units. In March 1997, the Board of Inquiry into the Black Hawk Training Accident in June 1996 recommended that dedicated Army aviation assets be allocated in support of the counter terrorist and special operations capability and that the units be collocated during training, planning and the conduct of operations. History The 171st Special Operations Aviation Squadron traces its lineage back to the 161st Reconnaissance Flight which was formed in June 1965 based at RAAF Base Amberley. The Flight was part of the 16th Army Light Aircraft Squadron which in 1967 became the 1st Aviation Regiment. The Flight served in Vietnam from 1965 to 1971 and during this period was renamed the 161st (Independent) Reconnaissance Flight. On return from Vietnam, the Flight was based at Oakey. On 31 January 1974, the Flight was re-designated as the \"171st Operational Support Squadron\" following a restructure of the 1st Aviation Regiment using the number from the disbanded 171st Air Cavalry Flight. On 19 December 2002, the Prime Minister announced the creation of the Special Operations Command and that the government would accelerate the purchase of the MRH90 Taipan helicopters to enable a squadron of helicopters to be based in Sydney as a potent addition to the Tactical Assault Group East. On 28 November 2004, 'A' Squadron of the 5th Aviation Regiment based at RAAF Base Townsville swapped designations with the 171st Operational Support Squadron. The squadron was equipped with the Sikorsky S-70A Black Hawk with the role of providing support to the Special Operations Command. The squadron separated from the 1st Aviation Regiment and was placed under the command of the 16th Aviation Brigade as an independent squadron and was re-designated as the \"171st Aviation Squadron\". The squadron was commanded by a lieutenant colonel in addition to the conventional squadron commander of Major rank. In July 2005, Holsworthy Barracks was selected as the location in Sydney to relocate the squadron. In December 2006, the squadron relocated to temporary facilities at Luscombe Airfield with the redevelopment of the airfield expected to be completed by late 2008. The squadron was involved in operations in East Timor as part of Operation Astute. On 29 November 2006, a Squadron Black Hawk helicopter crashed during Operation Quickstep while attached to HMAS Kanimbla off the coast of Fiji. The helicopter's pilot, Captain Mark Bingley, and Trooper Joshua Porter from the Special Air Service Regiment were killed in the crash. In March 2008, the squadron became part of the newly raised 6th Aviation Regiment following implementation of a recommendation from the Board of Inquiry into the Crash of Black Hawk 221 to raise a regiment. The squadron has been renamed the \"171st Special Operations Aviation Squadron\"; it has had a new name from at least January 2020. Aircraft The squadron is being equipped with the UH-60M Black Hawk. The squadron was equipped with the MRH90 Taipan an Australian variant of the NHI NH90. The 6th Aviation Regiment completed the transition from the S-70A-9 Black Hawk to the MRH90 in December 2021. The regiment was originally planned to have made the transition from the S-70A-9 Black Hawk to the MRH90 by December 2013 when the Black Hawk was scheduled to be retired from service. The MRH90 program encountered significant problems, and in particular, the NH90 had not been operated in a dedicated special operations role. In December 2015, Jane's Defence Weekly reported that the Chief of Army had delayed the retirement of the Black Hawk until the end of 2021. Twenty Black Hawks were retained with eighteen based at Holsworthy and two at the Oakey Army Aviation Centre in Oakey in order to develop a special operations capable MRH90. This required developing a Fast Roping and Rappelling Extraction System (FRRES) and a gun mount for the cabin door. The Taipan Gun Mount can fit either a M134D minigun or MAG 58 machine gun and when not in use can be moved into a outward stowed position to provide clearance to enable fast roping and rappelling. In February 2019, the first two of twelve MRH90s were delivered to the regiment. In 2016, the Australian government in the Defence White Paper 2016 announced a plan to acquire light helicopters for the regiment under Project Land 2097 Phase 4 that would fulfil roles that the MRH90 was unable to perform. In March 2023, Australian Defence Magazine reported that the light helicopter project had been cancelled as the UH-60M Black Hawk the Army was acquiring would fulfil this role. In December 2021, on the same day the S70A-9 Black Hawk was retired, the government announced that it would replace the MRH90s with new UH-60M Black Hawks. In September 2023, the MRH90 fleet was retired earlier than planned following the fatal crash of a 173rd Special Operations Aviation Squadron MRH90 during exercise Talisman Sabre in July 2023. In August 2023, the Army began receiving deliveries of UH-90Ms. See also British Joint Special Forces Aviation Wing Canadian 427 Special Operations Aviation Squadron French 4th Special Forces Helicopter Regiment Italian 3rd Special Operations Helicopter Regiment U.S. 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment – Night Stalkers Notes References Further reading 171 171 Military units and formations established in 1968 1968 establishments in Australia Helicopter units and formations Cold War history of Australia"}

{"text": "Lendinara is a comune in the province of Rovigo, Veneto, northern Italy. It is part of the historical and geographical region of Polesine. It is the birthplace of Domenico Montagnana (1680–1750), one of the world's finest violin and cello makers. Tenor Domenico Ronconi was also born in the town. In the latter part of the 19th century, it was the home of Jessie White Mario, the English woman who took an active part in the struggle for the Unification of Italy at the side of Mazzini and Garibaldi. Outside of the town stands the Sanctuary of Nostra Signora del Pilastrello (Our Lady of the Pilaster), at the site of a shrine built in the 16th century to house an icon of the Madonna. The abbey and church were reconstructed in the 19th century. Geography Territory Lendinara is located in the north-east of the Italian peninsula, in the middle western part of Polesine province and it's crossed by the Adigetto river, that divides it in two. Lendinara is 16 km far from the provincial capital Rovigo. Geographical coordinates: sexagesimal system: 45 ° 5 '6,72 \"N 11 ° 36' 2,52\" E decimal system: 45.0852 ° N 11.6007 ° E World Wide Locator: JN55TC Seismic classification: zone 4 (Very low seismic hazard) Climate According to the Köppen climate classification, Lendinara's has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). This is a temperate climate with hot and sometimes muggy summers and cold, wet winters. Precipitation is concentrated in the spring and autumn seasons. History Antiquity Numerous archaeological finds such as cinerary urns, tombstones, coins, glass and even traces of road and hydraulic works, show that a primitive center already existed in Roman times. Perhaps there were older settlements since some findings seem to derive their origin from the Middle East. Middle Ages The first historical document about Lendinara dates back to 870, when Uberto Cattaneo, from Verona, obtained from the Carolings the lordship over the town, a lordship that lasted for more than four centuries. Already in the XI century Lendinara was \"illustrious Castle, enriched with many factories and towers, cultured population\", as the Muratori called it. The castle was located to the left of the Adigetto canal and was surrounded by fortifications that contained a large part of the town. Outside the walls, however, there was the church of Santa Sofia and the convent of San Biagio around which various districts were forming. Lendinara was located in the middle of a very fertile territory and its rivers, Adige and Adigetto, fostered communications. The development was continuous and rapid with the construction of churches and villas and the presence of notaries, city families, and a developed municipal organization. From 1225 Lendinara had a Podesta and from 1321 it was given the first statute in the Polesine region. The city was destroyed by Ezzelino da Romano in 1246 because of the friendship of its inhabitants (Lendinaresi) with San Bonifacio. After this fire, a new city nucleus arose around the convent of the Franciscans, called 'San Marco'. The convent was suppressed in 1810, like the Abbey of Vangadizza di Badia Polesine. Around 1275, for a short period, the city became a republic. The Paduan bought the city in 1283 and then sold it to the Estensi. In this period the \"Granarone”, a large store of provisions, was built. The castle had a five-story tower, and a pit that surrounded the whole town, only a wooden bridge connected the center with the fortress. Four doors regulated access to the city. The fifteenth century was the golden age for culture for Lendinara, after being sold to the Venetians. The great school of the wood artisans Canozio was also born, among which excelled Lorenzo Canozio(1426-1477), author of works of gothic art.

{"text": "The third and largest Battle of Szikszó was fought in October 1588 between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Ottoman Empire as part of the Ottoman–Hungarian wars. The Hungarian forces were fewer in number, but were victorious over the Ottomans. This unexpected victory was even mentioned by Emperor Rudolf decades after the battle. It was one of the most important Hungarian victories in the post-Mohács period. Events In 1588, Pasha Sina of Buda marched with his soldiers towards Szikszó, which belonged to Hungary and refused to pay taxes to Porta. On October 8, Ottoman soldiers were already in the market town and looting when the border fort's rescue army led by Captain Sigismund Rákóczi from Eger arrived. In contrast to the Ottoman army of 11,000 the Hungarian-German army could have been 2,400–2,500. Despite the superiority, the latter still won. More than two thousand Ottomans and about 400–500 Hungarians and Germans were dead in the clash. In the wake of this incident, the Habsburg court in Prague suspended the payment of a “fair gift” of 30,000 gold a year, fixed in the Drinapolis peace, in response to which Porta threatened war. Prelude In 1588, Szikszó already owed 1,000 gold tax, so Sinan Pasha of Buda organized a punitive tax collect campaign. The six thousand cavalry and the same number of infantry were led by Kara Ali Beg, the commander of Fehérvár, against Putnok and then, after he could not take it, set off in the direction of Szikszó. The battle On the afternoon of October 8, the Pasha arrived under the city and immediately began the siege of the church fortress, which was protected by armed citizens. After two hours of siege, however, he was forced to retreat, because the rescue teams led by Major Sigismund Rákóczi from Eger arrived around 5 o'clock. With 2,000 Hungarian warriors and 500 German warriors. Kara Ali set fire to the church and the houses around it, then retreated to the Hernád-Velvet triangle, where he arranged his army. He arranged the riders on the right wing and the Janissaries on the left wing, setting up his four cannons in the middle. Rákóczi's army was led in the middle by István Drugeth Homonnai, chief of Zemplén, the most famous knight of Upper Hungary, the black shield horsemen attacked the left wing, while the German riflemen collided with the Janissaries. Kara Ali was seriously injured at the very beginning of the battle, so the command was taken over by Mustafa Szécsény, who also fell shortly afterwards. At that time the Janissaries broke through the army of the attacking Hungarian armies, István Drugeth was captured, and Rákóczi was already considering retreating, when the Hungarian left wing rushed to the aid of the Germans, and thus managed to repel the Janissaries. The order of war was completely disintegrated, and the struggle against man dragged on into the late night. By this time, the third Turkish chief, Bajazid basa, the leader of the Janissaries, had also fallen. Heling, the captain of the Germans, also fell. By 11, the Turkish armies ran away. The cavalry chased them to Sajó, and he also managed to free his Homons. 1,700 Turkish and hundreds of Hungarian and German soldiers died in the battle. Aftermath The common grave where the dead were buried has since been called Törökhalom. With this victory, Sigismund Rákóczi became famous, Emperor Rudolf, even decades after the battle, mentioned the brilliant triumph, which was especially valuable because of the difference in the numbers of the two armies.

History Yuseong first started its spa business in 1913, and by the 1970s, major developments were made, adding 12 more hotels to the area, leading this area to be designated first as the Special Spa District in 1981 and finally as the Yuseong Special Tourism District by August 31, 1994. To prevent centralization in Seoul, then-President Park Chung Hee concentrated the country's high tech industries in the Daedeok Science Town in the 1970s and the Expo '93 was held here. The area is in process of expanding into the International Science and Business Belt. Tourism and technology Since the time of the Baekje Kingdom, travellers have visited Yuseong's natural springs and spas.

{"text": "Pentalogy of Cantrell (or thoraco-abdominal syndrome) is a rare congenital syndrome that causes defects involving the diaphragm, abdominal wall, pericardium, heart and lower sternum. Presentation There are five characteristic findings in pentalogy of Cantrell: an abdominal wall defect, lower sternal defect, congenital heart malformations, absence of the diaphragmatic pericardium, and an anterior diaphragmatic defect. Abdominal wall defects in pentalogy of Cantrell occur above the umbilicus (supraumbilical) and in the midline, and have a wide range of presentations. Diastasis recti, hernias, and omphalocele have all been described in conjunction with the pentalogy. Sternal defects too have a range of presentations, from absence of the xiphoid process to shortened or cleft sternum. If the sternal defect is large enough, the neonate may have ectopia cordis, in which the heart is located outside of the thorax. Many congenital heart malformations have been described in conjunction with pentalogy of Cantrell. The most common is ventricular septal defect, found in 72% of cases. Others include atrial septal defect, cardiac diverticulum, pulmonic stenosis, double outlet right ventricle, tetralogy of Fallot, dextrocardia, and transposition of the great vessels. Causes Most cases of pentalogy of Cantrell are idiopathic (no known cause). However, some cases have been described with a genetic linkage to a locus at Xq25-q26.1. Epidemiology Pentalogy of Cantrell occurs in 1/65,000 to 1/200,000 live births. History It was first characterized in 1958. A 2010 study concluded that the 13th-century Christian saint Rose of Viterbo died of complications of Pentalogy of Cantrell.

{"text": "Giuseppe Cardone (born 3 March 1974) is a retired Italian footballer who played more than 300 games as a defender for a number of clubs in the Italian league. Career Born in Pavia, Cardone played youth football with Lombardy top-flight club A.C. Milan. He was named in the first team squad for the 1992–93 Serie A season as a reserve, but did not play any senior games for the club. He was loaned out in turn to Pavia (in Serie C2) and then Leffe (in Serie C1), Lucchese (in Serie B). In 1996, he was sold to fellow Serie A club Bologna F.C. 1909 in co-ownership deal.

{"text": "Archaeology Scotland, formerly known as the Council for Scottish Archaeology (CSA) is a membership organisation which seeks to promote the understanding of archaeology in Scotland. This group works with lay people and academia to help care for the great history of Scotland's archaeological heritage. Their charitable and philanthropic work serves to enrich the story and deep history of Scotland. The organization is responsible for coordinating a number of archaeology related events, such as Scottish Archaeology Month and Adopt-a-Monument. History and Background The organisation began as a branch of the Council for British Archaeology, established in 1944. One of the primary leaders of the movement was Dr. W.D. Simpson. Dr. Simpson wanted to entrust this Scottish group to: help to preserve Scottish heritage, antiquities, relics, and ancient buildings; also to preserve ancient country houses and help them to remain inhabited; and carry out the proper archaeological excavation of castles and abbeys. It was also decreed that the Council for British Archaeology (CBA) should find appropriate resources to address urgent archaeological problems. In order to move this charter forward, the CBA needed to work hand in hand with the government to formulate measures to educate the public regarding the care and preservation of historic monuments. In 1949, the Scottish Regional Group of the CBA outlined their own objectives. These would include: The advancement of archaeology from the 19th century through prehistoric times Public education Preservation of ancient Scottish monuments Raising awareness of the study of archaeology in Scottish universities Working collaboratively with other organizations to grow museum activities The original name of the organization was The Council for Scottish Archaeology. The Council for Scottish Archaeology became an independent body in 1988, and was reconstituted as a limited company in 2004. The name Archaeology Scotland was adopted in 2008. Archaeology Scotland is a registered Scottish charity, and is dependent on the subscriptions and donations of supporters, grants from, Historic Environment Scotland and trusts and foundations. Current Organization and Structure The organization is currently made up of trustees who answer to an appointed board of directors. The current director is Dr Gavin MacGregor, who took over from Eila Macqueen in 2022. Under Macqueen's leadership, there is a larger team of project managers, development managers, project officers, heritage training officers, and other assorted staff and administration. Activities Archaeology Scotland provides a variety of relevant services and information, including educational resources and publications. The group co-ordinates a number of initiatives including Scottish Archaeology Month, which takes place every September as part of European Heritage Days. Hundreds of free archaeological and heritage themed events take place all over Scotland, allowing people to view usually unseen artefacts and sites. Archaeology Scotland also organises the annual Archaeological Research in Progress conference in partnership with the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. One of the key fundraising awareness and initiatives is the Adopt-a-Monument event. Additionally, the Heritage Hero Awards and their journal \"Discovery and Excavation in Scotland\" is the premiere resource for learning more about current Scottish archaeological fieldwork. For more than 20 years, the organization has sponsored Scottish Archaeological Month (SAM) which works to engage people with the heritage and history of Scottish archaeology. Activities include lectures, performances, walking tours, and exhibitions. SAM takes place in September and runs through mid-October. The group also works with young people running summer schools and young archaeologists' clubs.

{"text": "The Operative Bricklayers' Society (OBS) was a British New Model Trade Union based in London. History The society was founded in 1818 as the London Bricklayers' Society, but by 1829 had developed into a national operative union. By the 1840s the union had about 1,400 members, roughly 2% of the total number of bricklayers in the country at the time. In 1848, twelve former members of the Operative Bricklayers refounded the organisations as the London Order of Operative Bricklayers' Society. They led a strike in 1851 which won an early finish on Saturdays, and in 1854 succeeded in gaining a wage increase for bricklayers in the capital. In 1859 the union became embroiled in a dispute with employers over the introduction of a nine-hour working day, and the consequential London builders' strike was led by George Howell. The OBS was defeated, and subsequently only developed very gradually outside London. In 1867, the union increased contributions from 3d to 10½d a week, and membership dropped from 5,000 to 2,000. However, in the long run, this improved the union's financial position and strength, and by 1877 it had 6,749 members. By 1900 the union had 38,830 members, but roughly half were based in London. In 1921 the OBS merged with the Manchester Unity of Operative Bricklayers' Society and the Operative Society of Masons, Quarrymen and Allied Trades of England and Wales to form the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers (AUBTW). The People's History Museum in Manchester holds the original emblem painting of the Operative Bricklayers' Society. It was painted in 1869 by Royal Academician Arthur Waudby, and hung in the Bricklayers' Head Office in London. It shows the society's work, proudly depicting the bricklayers' trade along with symbols of truth, architecture and science.

{"text": "Ectopia cordis (Greek: \"away / out of place\" + Latin: \"heart\") or ectopic heart is a congenital malformation in which the heart is abnormally located either partially or totally outside of the thorax. The ectopic heart can be found along a spectrum of anatomical locations, including the neck, chest, or abdomen. In most cases, the heart protrudes outside the chest through a split sternum. Pathology Ectopia cordis results from a failure of proper maturation of midline mesoderm and ventral body wall (chest) formation during embryonic development. The exact etiology remains unknown, but abnormalities in the lateral body wall folds are believed to be involved. Normally, the lateral body walls are responsible for fusion at the midline to form the ventral wall. Corruption of this process may underlie ectopia cordis. Defective ventral body wall formation yields a heart unprotected by the pericardium, sternum, or skin. Other organs may also have formed outside the skin, as well. Many cases of ectopia cordis have associated congenital heart defects, in which the heart has failed to properly form. Defects more commonly associated with ectopia cordis include: Intracardiac defects Atrial septal defect Ventricular septal defect Tetralogy of Fallot Tricuspid atresia Double outlet right ventricle Non-cardiac malformations Pentalogy of Cantrell Omphalocele Anterior diaphragmatic hernia Cleft palate Diagnosis The Diagnosis of ectopia cordis is found with a routine ultrasound as early as the first trimester or the beginning of the second trimester. Treatment Due to the rarity and rapid postpartum mortality of ectopia cordis, limited treatment options have been developed. Only some successful surgeries have been performed as of now, and the mortality rate remains high. Prognosis The prognosis of ectopia cordis depends on classification according to three factors: Location of the defect Cervical Thoracic Thoracoabdominal Abdominal Extent of the cardiac displacement Presence or absence of intracardiac defects Some studies have suggested a better prognosis with surgery in cases of thoracoabdominal ectopia cordis or less severe pentalogy of Cantrell. In general, the prognosis for ectopia cordis is poor—most cases result in death shortly after birth due to infection, hypoxemia, or cardiac failure. Epidemiology The occurrence of ectopia cordis is 8 per million births. It is typically classified according to location of the ectopic heart, which includes: Cervical Thoracic Thoracoabdominal Abdominal Thoracic and thoraco-abdominal ectopia cordis constitute the vast majority of known cases.

{"text": "Clarence Greene (August 10, 1913 – June 17, 1995) was an American screenwriter and film producer who is noted for the \"offbeat creativity and originality of his screenplays and for films noir and television episodes produced in the 1950s. Career Starting with the 1944 film The Town Went Wild, Greene co-wrote many stories and scripts with Russell Rouse. The partners are noted for their work on a series of six film noirs, starting with D.O.A. (directed by Rudolph Maté-1949). With The Well (1951), they took on directing and producing: Rouse as director and Greene as producer. This collaboration continued with The Thief (1952), Wicked Woman (1953), New York Confidential (1955), and House of Numbers (1957). In the late 1950s, Greene and Rouse formed Greene-Rouse Productions, which created the television series Tightrope that ran for one season (1959–1960) as well as two films in the 1960s. In addition to their noir work, Rouse and Greene produced two westerns: The Fastest Gun Alive (1956) and Thunder in the Sun (1959). The 1959 film Pillow Talk was based on their story. Their careers drew to a close shortly after the unsuccessful film The Oscar (1966). Rouse and Greene were nominated for the Academy Award for writing The Well (1951). They received the Academy Award for Pillow Talk (1959) (with Maurice Richlin and Stanley Shapiro). D.O.A. has been preserved in the National Film Registry. That film has been remade several times, and they were credited as writers on two of them: the Australian remake Color Me Dead from 1969 and the D.O.A remake of 1988.

{"text": "Donald John Trump Jr. (born December 31, 1977) is an American businessman, former television presenter, political activist, and author. He is the eldest child of Donald Trump and his first wife Ivana Trump. Trump serves as a trustee and executive vice president of The Trump Organization, running the company alongside his younger brother Eric. During their father's presidency, the brothers continued to do deals and investments in foreign countries, as well as collect payments in their U.S. properties from foreign governments, despite a pledge that they would not do so. Trump also served as a boardroom judge on his father's TV show The Apprentice. He authored Triggered in 2019 and Liberal Privilege in 2020. Trump was active in his father's 2016 presidential campaign. He cooperated with Russia in their interference in the 2016 United States elections and had a meeting with a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information about the campaign of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Trump campaigned for several Republicans during the 2018 midterm elections. He has promoted several conspiracy theories. Trump was also active in his father's 2020 presidential campaign, often being on the campaign trail and being featured in the news for making unfounded claims. During the election he called for \"total war\" as the results were counted and promoted the stolen election conspiracy theory. Following his father's defeat, he engaged in attempts to overturn the results. He spoke at the rally that led to the storming of the Capitol, where he threatened Trump's opponents that \"we're coming for you.\" In January 2021, Attorney General for the District of Columbia Karl Racine said that he is looking at whether to charge Donald Trump Jr. with inciting the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol in the criminal investigation into the attack. CNN reported in April 2022 that two days after the election, Trump Jr. sent a text message to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows outlining paths to subvert the Electoral College process and ensure his father a second term. Early life Trump was born on December 31, 1977, in Manhattan, New York City, to Ivana and Donald Trump. He has two younger siblings, Ivanka and Eric. He also has two half siblings, Tiffany, from his father's marriage to Marla Maples, and Barron, from his father's current marriage to Melania Trump. Through his father, Trump is a grandson of Fred Trump and great-grandson of Elizabeth Christ Trump, who founded what became the Trump Organization. As a boy, Trump found a role model in his maternal grandfather, Miloš Zelníček, who had a home near Prague, where he spent summers camping, fishing, hunting and learning the Czech language. His parents divorced when he was 12 years old due to his father having an extramarital affair. Trump Jr. was estranged from his father for one year after the divorce, furious at his actions which broke up the family. Trump was educated at Buckley School and The Hill School, a college preparatory boarding school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, followed by the University of Pennsylvania's (Penn) Wharton School, where he graduated in 2000 with a B.S. in Economics. Career After graduating from Penn in 2000, Trump moved to Aspen, Colorado, where he hunted, fished, skied, lived in a truck, and worked as a bartender for a year, before returning to join the Trump Organization in New York. Trump has supervised building projects, which included 40 Wall Street, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and Trump Park Avenue, In 2006 he helped launch Trump Mortgage, which collapsed less than a year later. In 2010, he became a spokesperson and \"executive director of global branding\" for Cambridge Who's Who, a vanity publisher against whom hundreds of complaints had already been filed with the Better Business Bureau. He appeared as a guest adviser and judge on many episodes of his father's reality television show The Apprentice, from season 5 in 2006 to his father's last season in 2015. Trump Organization On January 11, 2017, Trump's father announced that he and his brother Eric would oversee a trust that included the Trump Organization's assets while his father was president, to avert a conflict of interest. Amid the Trump–Ukraine scandal – where Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter BidenTrump Jr. strongly criticized Hunter Biden, accusing him of nepotism and leveraging his father as a means to get financial benefits. Trump Jr. said, \"When you're the father and your son's entire career is dependent on that, they own you.\" Trump Jr. was widely ridiculed for these remarks by Trevor Noah and others. Trump Jr. is a high-level executive in his father's business and has continued to operate and promote the family's businesses across the world during Trump's presidency. The Associated Press wrote of Trump Jr.'s, remarks that he was \"showing no self-awareness that he, too, has at least in part been successful because of a famous father\". According to The Washington Post fact-checker, Trump Jr.'s assertion that he and his family members had gotten out of foreign business deals after Trump became president is false. The Washington Post reported that after Trump became president, \"Trump's sons have been busy selling assets to foreign individuals, expanding or adding onto their existing deals and investments in foreign countries, and collecting payments in U.S. properties from foreign governments.\" In February 2018, advertisements in Indian newspapers promoted a deal whereby anyone who purchased Trump Organization apartments in Gurgaon before February 20 would be invited to have a \"conversation and dinner\" with Trump Jr. The ads were criticized by corruption watchdogs as unethical. Podcast In 2023, Trump launched a podcast, Triggered with Don Jr, on the platform Rumble. Involvement in politics 2016 presidential campaign Ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Trump Jr. was a central member of his father's campaign, characterized by The New York Times as a \"close political adviser\". He spoke at the Republican National Convention, along with his siblings Ivanka, Eric and Tiffany. Trump Jr. influenced his father's choice of Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke during the presidential transition. Since his father's victory in the 2016 election, Trump Jr. has developed what The Washington Post calls a \"public persona as a right-wing provocateur and ardent defender of Trumpism\". The Atlantic reported in 2019 that Trump had described Trump Jr. in 2017 as \"not the sharpest knife in the drawer\". Trump Jr. earned the nickname \"Fredo\" among some Trump campaign staffers, a reference to a character in The Godfather. Trump Tower meeting On June 9, 2016, Trump Jr. attended a meeting arranged by publicist Rob Goldstone on behalf of Azerbaijani-Russian businessman Emin Agalarov. The meeting was held in Trump Tower in Manhattan, among three members of the presidential campaign: Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafortand Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, her translator Anatoli Samochornov, Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, and Ike Kaveladze, a Georgian-American, U.S.-based senior vice president at Crocus Group, the real estate development company run by Aras Agalarov. Approximately a year later, Trump Jr. initially told the media that adoption of Russian children was the main subject of the meeting. On July 8, 2017, Trump Jr. tweeted his email exchange with Goldstone. It revealed that Trump Jr. had agreed to attend the meeting with the understanding he would receive information damaging to Hillary Clinton. Goldstone also wrote in one of Trump Jr.'s publicly disclosed emails that the Russian government was involved. Robert Mueller, the special counsel of the Department of Justice in charge of Russia-related investigations, investigated the emails and the meeting. Although the White House lauded Trump Jr. for his transparency, he released the e-mails only after The New York Times had informed him that they had them and were going to publish a story about them. In June 2019, Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee made a criminal referral of Trump Jr. to federal prosecutors on suspicions that he misled the committee with his testimony. Meeting with Gulf states emissary Trump Jr. had a meeting in August 2016 with an emissary for the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia who offered help to the Trump presidential campaign. The meeting included Joel Zamel, an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation; George Nader, an envoy representing the crown princes of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia; and American businessman Erik Prince. Correspondence with WikiLeaks In November 2017, news broke that Julian Assange had used the WikiLeaks Twitter account to correspond with Donald Trump Jr. during the 2016 presidential election. Trump Jr. had already provided this correspondence to congressional investigators who were looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The correspondence showed that WikiLeaks actively solicited the cooperation of Trump Jr., who was a campaign surrogate and advisor in the campaign of his father. WikiLeaks urged the Trump campaign to reject the results of the 2016 presidential election at a time when it appeared the Trump campaign would lose. WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share an unsubstantiated claim that Hillary Clinton had wanted to attack Assange with drones. WikiLeaks also shared a link to a website that would help people search through Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's hacked e-mails, which WikiLeaks had recently made public. Trump Jr. shared both. 2018 midterm election campaigns During the 2018 midterms election cycle, Trump actively campaigned on behalf of Republican candidates, including for Matt Rosendale, Patrick Morrisey, Mike Braun, Ron DeSantis, Lee Zeldin and Matt Gaetz. He raised millions of dollars for Republican candidates, was second only to his father in his ability to draw crowds to campaign events, and is credited with helping Republican candidates win. Other political activities In 2007, Trump Jr. gave $4,000 to then-Senator Hillary Clinton's campaign to be the Democratic presidential nominee. In 2011, Trump Jr. responded to criticism of the Tea Party movement by Florida representative Frederica Wilson by confusing Wilson with California representative Maxine Waters and saying her colorful hats made her look like a stripper. In April 2017, he campaigned for Montana congressional candidate Greg Gianforte, and in May met with Republican National Committee officials to discuss the party's strategy and resources. In September 2017, Trump Jr. asked to have his Secret Service detail removed, telling friends he wanted more privacy, the second presidential child to do so. The request was criticized by former Secret Service agents. Trump Jr.'s protection was restored later that month. In October 2020, it was reported that Pennsylvania Republicans were suggesting Trump Jr. run for the vacant Senate seat in Pennsylvania in 2022 after two-term incumbent Pat Toomey announced he would not be seeking re-election. In the same month, Trump Jr. held a crowded indoor rally where attendees did not wear masks, contradicting public health guidelines. In an October 29 interview with Fox News's Laura Ingraham, Trump Jr. asserted that the coronavirus death rate has dropped to \"almost nothing\", adding \"(b)ecause we've gotten control of this thing. We understand how it works – they have the therapeutics to be able to deal with this. If you look at that, look at my Instagram, it's gone down to almost nothing.\" On that day, the number of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. was 1,063. Trump has been the subject of speculation for a 2024 run for president. In October 2020, he posted a photo to his Instagram account of a \"Don Jr. 2024\" flag. Views and controversies Race and immigration During his father's presidential campaign, Trump Jr. caused controversy in 2016 when he posted an image that compared Syrian refugees to Skittles, saying \"If I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you just three would kill you, would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem.\" The makers of Skittles condemned the tweet, saying \"Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy.\" The Cato Institute claimed that year that the chances \"an American would be killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee was one in 3.64 billion\" per year. On March 1, 2016, an interview with white supremacist James Edwards and Trump Jr. was aired. The campaign initially denied the interview had taken place; later Trump Jr. claimed it was unintentional. As a consequence of the interview, mainstream media outlets have accused Trump Jr. of being either a believer in the white genocide conspiracy theory, or pretending to be an advocate for political gain. In September 2016, Trump Jr. cited Holocaust imagery to criticize what he perceived as the mainstream media's uncritical coverage of Hillary Clinton during her campaign, by \"letting her slide on every discrepancy\", while also accusing Democrats involved in the 2016 campaign of lying. Trump Jr. said if the Republicans were committing the same offences mainstream outlets would be \"warming up the gas chamber right now\". Also that month, Trump Jr. shared an image on Instagram depicting a cross between his father and Pepe the Frog. When asked on Good Morning America about Pepe the Frog and its associations with white supremacy, Trump Jr. said he had never heard of Pepe the Frog and thought it was just a \"frog with a wig\". In April 2017, Trump Jr. lauded conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich, who has promoted the debunked white genocide and Pizzagate conspiracy theories, saying, \"In a long gone time of unbiased journalism he'd win the Pulitzer\". In August 2020, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported that Trump Jr. appeared at a far-right \"We Build the Wall\" event with Neo-Nazi collaborator Jack Posobiec in July 2019. Promotion of conspiracy theories Trump Jr. retweeted conspiratorial remarks by white supremacist Kevin B. MacDonald about alleged favors exchanged by Hillary Clinton and Switzerland's largest bank. On the campaign trail, Trump Jr. promoted Alex Jones' conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton wore an earpiece to a presidential forum and that official unemployment rates were manipulated for political purposes. In March 2017, Trump Jr. criticized the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, after the 2017 Westminster attack, which in turn led British lawmakers to criticize Trump Jr. British journalists said Trump Jr. had quoted Khan out of context when he criticized him. Khan did not respond to the criticism, saying he had \"far more important things\" to do. In May 2017, Trump Jr. promoted what CNN called the \"long-debunked, far-right conspiracy theory\" that Bill Clinton was linked to Vince Foster's death. In November, Trump Jr. again promoted the conspiracy theory that the Clintons had murdered people. In February 2018, Trump Jr. liked two tweets promoting a conspiracy theory that survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting were coached into propagating anti-Trump rhetoric. In May 2018, Trump Jr. retweeted a false and antisemitic conspiracy theory that George Soros, the Jewish Hungarian-American businessman and philanthropist, was a \"nazi [sic] who turned in his fellow Jews to be murdered in German concentration camps & stole their wealth\". The tweets originated from Roseanne Barr, whose TV show Roseanne was canceled the same day after she had posted a series of racist and antisemitic tweets. A spokesperson for Soros responded to the tweets, \"George Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary as a 13-year-old child by going into hiding and assuming a false identity with the help of his father, who managed to save his own family and help many other Jews survive the Holocaust\". In June 2018, Trump Jr. liked a tweet suggesting that the migrant children separated from their parents due to the Trump administration family separation policy were actually actors. In August 2018, Trump Jr. shared on Instagram a doctored image which had been crudely edited to falsely state that CNN had reported President Trump's approval rating as 50%. The actual CNN report had Trump at 40%, below Barack Obama's 45% at the same point of his presidency. Trump Jr. deleted the image two days later. In September 2018, when Hurricane Florence was affecting the United States, Trump Jr. tweeted a picture of CNN journalist Anderson Cooper waist-deep in floodwaters when another man in the same picture was standing knee-deep a distance away. In the same tweet, Trump Jr. included a link to a Breitbart News article claiming that CNN's ratings had dropped by 41%, and proposed a conspiracy theory that CNN was \"lying to try to make [his father, President Trump] look bad\". In actuality, the picture of Cooper was about 10 years old, taken during 2008's Hurricane Ike before Trump became president, and Cooper was videoed talking about how the floodwaters were receding. In May 2020, Trump Jr. falsely accused Joe Biden of being a pedophile. In August 2020, Trump Jr. shared a Breitbart News article about more than 800 dead people voting in Michigan which was framed to suggest that the ballots were not legitimately cast and thus showed evidence of extensive voter fraud; however, the voters in question died after submitting the ballots, and the ballots were rejected by Michigan authorities who knew the voters had died before the election date. In September 2020, he again pushed false claims about voter fraud by asserting, \"The radical left are laying the groundwork to steal this election from my father\". He added: \"Their plan is to add millions of fraudulent ballots that can cancel your vote and overturn the election\", and asked \"able-bodied\" people to join an election security \"army\" for his father. Facebook and Twitter affixed labels to the video which pointed to accurate information about voting. In November 2020, after Pfizer announced that it had developed a COVID-19 vaccine with 90% effectiveness, Trump Jr. suggested that the vaccine had been held back in order to hurt his father's chances of winning the election. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla dismissed the suggestion, saying that the company had always planned to rely on the \"speed of science\". After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Trump Jr. amplified baseless Russian state propaganda which claimed that the US and Ukraine were developing biological weapons. COVID-19 misinformation Trump Jr. was given a 12-hour restriction by Twitter in July 2020 after he promoted misinformation about COVID-19 by retweeting a video showing Houston doctor Stella Immanuel promoting hydroxychloroquine as a cure despite conflicting studies, and claiming that masks are unnecessary. Twitter later said that it restricted the ability to tweet or retweet for twelve hours for violating its COVID-19 misinformation policy. On October 29, 2020, Trump Jr. criticized the media's focus on new infections rather than on deaths, saying on Fox News, \"why aren't they talking about deaths? Oh, oh, because the number is almost nothing. Because we've gotten control of this, and we understand how it works.\" On the day Trump Jr. made that comment, the United States registered roughly 1,000 COVID-19 deaths. Other In 2016, Trump Jr. posted a photo on Instagram featuring a Trump version of Pepe the Frog, an internet meme used by white nationalists and white supremacists. Trump Jr. defended the post and called criticism of it \"ridiculous\". On October 31, 2017, Trump Jr. tweeted that he would take away half his three-year-old daughter's Halloween candy because, he wrote, \"it's never too early to teach her about socialism.\" On November 7, 2017, he posted tweets urging voters in Virginia's gubernatorial election to vote \"tomorrow\", the day after the election. In November 2019, Trump Jr. tweeted the name of the alleged whistleblower who brought to light the Trump-Ukraine scandal. Whistleblower conventions are intended to protect the identity of individuals who expose wrongdoing in government. Agence France-Presse attempted to independently verify the identity that Trump Jr. tweeted, but was unable to do so. In June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump Jr. accused liberals of hypocrisy, for imposing restrictive measures and social distancing guidelines on businesses while holding the \"Action for Black Trans Lives\" protest for the rights of African-American transgender people. Trump Jr. has accused big tech companies of being biased against conservatives and has claimed that a deep state sought to undermine Trump during his presidency. Attempts to overturn the 2020 election Trump has had a prominent role in his father's attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election since November 2020. He has threatened Republican lawmakers who did not help his father overturn the election. In November 2020, he advocated \"total war\" instead of completion of vote counting in the 2020 United States elections. CNN reported in April 2022 that two days after the election, Trump Jr. sent a text message to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows outlining paths to subvert the Electoral College process and ensure his father a second term. He wrote, \"It's very simple. We have multiple paths. We control them all. We have operational control. Total leverage. Moral high ground. POTUS must start second term now.\" He continued, \"Republicans control 28 states Democrats 22 states. Once again Trump wins,\" adding, \"We either have a vote WE control and WE win OR it gets kicked to Congress 6 January 2021.\" Biden had not yet been declared the winner at the time of the text. Relation to the January 6 Capitol attack Together with his father and other speakers, on January 6, 2021, Trump Jr. spoke to an audience and, speaking about reluctant GOP lawmakers saying, \"If you're gonna be the zero and not the hero, we're coming for you\". President Trump further incited the crowd which then marched to the US Capitol building, where they forced entry, broke windows and vandalized the building. One woman was killed, and a police officer and three other people died during or shortly after the incursion. Television host and former congressman Joe Scarborough called for the arrest of Trump Jr., along with his father and Rudolph Giuliani, for insurrection against the United States. Following his father's permanent ban from Twitter on January 8, 2021, Donald Trump Jr. claimed that free speech \"no longer exists in America\". On March 5, 2021, Representative Eric Swalwell filed a civil lawsuit against Trump Jr. and three others (his father, Representative Mo Brooks, and Rudy Giuliani), seeking damages for their alleged role in inciting the riot. In December 2021, text messages released by Meadows revealed that Trump Jr. begged Meadows to persuade his father to stop the attack. Criminal investigation On January 11, 2021, D.C. attorney general Karl Racine said that Donald Trump Jr. is a person of interest in the criminal investigation of the attack on the U.S. Capitol and that he is looking at whether to charge him, along with Rudy Giuliani and Mo Brooks, with inciting the violent attack. Fraud investigation On January 14, 2021, it became known that Trump Jr. is a person of interest in the criminal investigation into misuse of his father's inaugural funds in Washington D.C., and that prosecutors intend to interview him over his role in \"grossly overpaying\" for use of event space at the Trump Hotel in Washington for the 2017 inauguration. Books Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us In 2019, Trump Jr. released the book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us. The book is critical of political correctness, and argues that the American left has a victimhood complex. The Washington Post commented: \"yet, in his telling, the real victim is often him, his father or another Trump family member\". In the book, Trump Jr. pushes conspiracy theories about how the intelligence community has attempted to harm President Trump, comparing President Trump's experiences with the FBI harassment campaign against civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Trump Jr. wrote of a visit to Arlington National Cemetery (a military cemetery), commenting that he got emotional looking at the graves and that it reminded him of \"all the sacrifices\" the Trump family had made, including \"voluntarily giving up a huge chunk of our business and all international deals to avoid the appearance that we were 'profiting off of the office'.\" Fact-checkers have reported that Trump still owns the family business, and that the Trump family have continued to engage in international business deals since Trump became president. In a review for The Washington Post, Carlos Lozada said that it \"fails as memoir and as polemic: its analysis is facile, its hypocrisy relentless, its self-awareness marginal (the writing is wretched, even by the standards of political vanity projects)\". The book was a New York Times best-seller. The book was purchased in bulk by at least nine Republican organizations, candidates or advocacy groups, including N.R.C.C. and the RNC which bought $75,000 and $100,000 worth of the books, respectively. Turning Point USA and the National Republican Senatorial Committee purchased approximately 2,000 and 2,500 books, respectively. Liberal Privilege: Joe Biden and the Democrats' Defense of the Indefensible In 2020, Trump Jr. self-published the book Liberal Privilege: Joe Biden and the Democrats' Defense of the Indefensible. Trump Jr. reportedly hired three researchers to collect information about Joe Biden and spent three months writing the book. Trump Jr. explained to The New York Times his reasons: \"While I had no plans for a book this year, I was stuck indoors like the rest of the nation during the pandemic\", he said, adding that he \"decided to highlight Biden's half century of being a swamp monster, since the media wouldn't do it\". The same article stated that he decided to self-publish because he could count on the publicity of \"his own platformand the promise of bulk purchases from the RNC\". The book was indeed bought in bulk by the RNC. On October 28, 2020, the RNC paid over $300,000 of donor money to Pursuit Venture LLC, a company owned by Trump Jr., for \"donor mementos\". It was the most money the RNC had ever paid for this purpose. The hardcover retails for $29.99, which suggests roughly how many copies might have been purchased, and the RNC's intent was to give a copy to people who donated $50–$100. Personal life Family In 2003, Trump Jr. began dating model Vanessa Kay Haydon at his father's suggestion. The couple married on November 12, 2005, at his father's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida; the service was officiated by Trump Jr.'s aunt, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry. Haydon's grandfather was Danish jazz musician Kai Ewans. They have five children: daughter Kai Madison (b. May 2007), son Donald John III (b. February 2009), son Tristan Milos (b. October 2011), son Spencer Frederick (b. October 2012), and daughter Chloe Sophia (b. June 2014). The oldest daughter, Kai, is named after Kai's great-grandfather, Kai Ewans. On March 15, 2018, it was announced that the couple had separated and she had filed for uncontested divorce in Manhattan Supreme Court. However, later it was revealed that the divorce was contested. The complaint was secret except for the title of the case. On February 22, 2019, they announced that they settled their divorce at the end of 2018. Since 2018, Trump Jr. has been dating Kimberly Guilfoyle. Guilfoyle had been friends with the Trump family for years. The two reportedly became engaged on December 31, 2020, though news of the engagement was not made public until January 2022. In December 2021, Trump Jr. switched his official residency from New York to Florida. Hunting Trump Jr. is an enthusiastic hunter. Controversy erupted in 2012 when the pictures he had taken of his hunting trophies in 2010 were published, including by Mia Farrow, who reposted them in 2015 and 2019. Trump Jr. responded by saying \"I'm not going to run and hide because the peta [sic] crazies don't like me\". In one photo, Trump Jr. has his arms around a dead leopard; in another, he is holding a knife in one hand and a bloody elephant tail in the other. Although the hunt was legal, anti-hunting activists criticized him. At least one sponsor dropped his father's TV show The Celebrity Apprentice. On Earth Day in 2017, Trump Jr. legally hunted prairie dogs in Montana with GOP Congressional candidate Greg Gianforte. ProPublica revealed on December 11, 2019, that the government of Mongolia retroactively granted Trump Jr. a hunting permit for the endangered Argali mountain sheep. The sheep hunt and travel to Ulaanbaatar for a private meeting with Mongolian president Khaltmaagiin Battulga cost US taxpayers $76,859.36 for United States Secret Service protection, according to two Freedom of Information Act requests by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). Humane Society International wildlife vice president Teresa Telecky said, \"For trophy hunters to travel to Mongolia to kill a beautiful and endangered ram is an absolute outrage\". In February 2020 Trump agreed to go on a hunting trip in Alaska with the winner of a fundraising auction for the Safari Club International.

{"text": "David John Nash, OBE RA (born 14 November 1945) is a British sculptor based in Blaenau Ffestiniog. Nash has worked worldwide with wood, trees and the natural environment. Early life David Nash was born at Esher, Surrey, and raised with his older brother Chris in Weybridge, Surrey where they both attended preparatory school. He spent all his childhood holidays in Ffestiniog, Wales David helped clear and replant a nearby forest that his father owned, and also worked for the Commercial Forestry Group. He learned about wood of many kinds and learned he hated planting trees in rows. Artistic career He attended Brighton College from 1959 to 1963, then Kingston College of Art from 1963 to 1967 and the Chelsea School of Art as a postgraduate from 1969 to 1970. Nash was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1999. In 2004, he was awarded the Order of the British Empire. A significant exhibition of his work is displayed in the Yorkshire Sculpture Park for a period in 2010/11. Kew Gardens currently has a working exhibition, launched in June 2012. David Nash is working on site in a 'wood quarry', his first for 10 years, to create new works at Kew. Artistic creations David Nash is known for works in wood and shaping living trees. His large wood sculptures are sometimes carved or partially burned to produce blackening. His main tools for these sculptures are a chainsaw and an axe to carve the wood and a blowtorch to char the wood. Nash also makes land art, of which the best known is Wooden Boulder, begun in 1978. This work involves the journey of a large wooden sphere from a Welsh mountainside to the Atlantic Ocean. Wooden Boulder is a large wooden sphere carved by Nash in the North Wales landscape and left there to weather. Over the years, the boulder has slipped, rolled and sometime been pushed through the landscape following the course of streams and rivers until finally it was last seen in the estuary of the river Dwyryd. It was thought to have been washed out to sea but, after being missing for over five years, the boulder reappeared in June 2009. Indications are that it had been buried in sand in the estuary. The sculptor had no idea of its location, and enjoys the notion that wood which grew out of the land will finally return to it. The boulder was last seen in 2015. Nash also makes sculptures which stay in the landscape. For example, Ash Dome is a ring of ash trees he planted in 1977 and trained to form a domed shape. The dome is sited at a secret location somewhere in Snowdonia and whenever it is filmed, crews are taken there by a circuitous route to guard its security. In the late 1980s, Nash worked at the Djerassi resident artist program, near Woodside, California, where he used Redwood and Madrone wood for his sculptures. Nash has worked with schools, university groups, and teachers throughout his career. He has created a varied body of work in which the relationship between man and nature is a central theme. His artistic ethos has been one of direct, physical involvement with his chosen material – wood – and the landscape. Since 1967, his sculpture has formed two distinctive groupings; sculptures which connect with the outside, the landscape of making and placements, and works which are presented inside, within and in relation to, architectural environments. The inorganic, non-allusive sculptures that Nash makes using unseasoned wood are based on the universal geometry of the cube, the sphere and the pyramid. He uses the directions of mark-making to his favoured forms: vertical for the cube, horizontal for the sphere, and diagonal for the pyramid. Although the innate character of the material is taken into account, and allowed to affect the outcome, he never allows it to dictate the sculpture's final identity. Nash takes a different approach to carving. Rather than chisels and abrasives, he uses chain saws and a blowtorch. For his work habitat received the 2016 Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture.

{"text": "Landis+Gyr is a publicly listed, multinational corporation operating in over 30 countries and headquartered in Cham, Switzerland. Landis+Gyr makes meters and related software for electricity and gas utilities. History Landis+Gyr was founded in 1896 as Theiler & Co. in Zug, in the canton of Zug, Switzerland, by technician Richard Theiler and entrepreneur Adelrich Gyr. It began by manufacturing electricity meters that were developed by Theiler. Heinrich Landis joined the business in 1903, acquired it in 1904 and introduced Karl Heinrich Gyr as a partner in 1905, renaming it Landis & Gyr. The company benefited from the rise of the electronics industry and expanded abroad over the following years. By 1914, when it was made a joint-stock company, it was the largest employer in the canton of Zug, with over 800 employees. In the 1920s, Landis & Gyr opened offices in New York City and Australia and took over competitors to form a global technology group. From the 1930s, the company diversified with telemetry and remote control products. After leadership struggles in the 1950s, a new management reorganized the financing and accounting and converted Landis & Gyr into a holding company. The range was expanded to include service machines, air conditioning and ventilation products. Landis & Gyr increased its personnel, with 14,000 employees around 1970 (5,200 of them in Zug). From the mid-1970s and especially after 1984, the group was frequently restructured. In 1987, Landis & Gyr was acquired by Stephan Schmidheiny, who sold it to Elektrowatt in 1995. It is today a part of Siemens Building Technologies. The company was also known for producing optical phone cards until 2006. Landis+Gyr phone cards were used in many countries such as Israel, Belgium, Switzerland and more. Ownership and acquisitions 1976 – Landis+Gyr acquired Duncan Electric Company of Lafayette, Indiana. 1987 – Landis+Gyr acquired MCC Powers of Chicago. MCC Powers had by then been a long established entity in the US building management market. Spurred by the liberalization and deregulation of global markets, Landis+Gyr re-oriented its business, adding electronic products. Late 1990s – In the late 1990s, Landis+Gyr went through a series of different investors and owners, amongst them Elektrowatt, KKR and Siemens. 2004 – Landis+Gyr was acquired by then Australia-based Bayard Capital for an undisclosed amount. Bayard Capital had already acquired the British metering company Ampy Automation-Digilog. As Bayard Capital continued to add other acquisitions to the group, 2008 saw the Landis+Gyr name being extended to the whole group in May 2008. An organizational realignment took place under Bayard Capital's ownership. The company moved to a regional structure, assigning regional corporate structures for North America; South America; UK/Pre-Payment; Europe; and Asia Pacific. 2006 – Landis+Gyr acquired Finnish Enermet Group, and also Hunt Technologies and Cellnet Technologies, both of which are from the United States. 2011 – Landis+Gyr was acquired by Toshiba Corporation of Japan for US$2.3 billion. 2017 – On July 21, 2017, Landis+Gyr listed its shares (ticker symbol: LAND) on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Utilities Various utilities have worked with Landis+Gyr in meeting their consumers' demand for energy management tools by rolling out smart meters. Below are some of the utilities that have worked with Landis+Gyr in deploying smart metering technology to energy consumers. Europe, Middle East & Africa: British Gas; Iberdrola; Électricité Réseau Distribution France (ERDF); E.ON; Järvi-Suomen Energia Oy; Vattenfall; Eskom; RWE.

{"text": "The Adelaide Central Market is a major fresh produce market in Adelaide, South Australia. As one of the oldest markets in Australia, Adelaide Central Market has a large range of fresh food, including fruit and vegetables, meat and poultry, seafood, cheeses, baked goods, small goods, and health foods, along with several cafés and eateries. Currently, approximately one million kilograms of fresh produce are delivered to the market and sold every month. It is a popular tourist attraction in the city, with more than 8.5 million visitors every year. It is also referred to simply as the Central Market. A $400 million redevelopment was approved in January 2021, which will include a mixed-use 35-storey building comprising offices, residential apartments and a hotel. History Establishment The Market began in Grote Street in 1869 and was known as the City Markets, with its official opening by Mayor Judah Solomon on 23 January 1870. Later that year, three acres of land were bought for £2,600 in the present-day location. However, the main markets at that time were the East End Markets that existed between Rundle Street and North Terrace. These markets would rival the Adelaide Central Market until 1988. Some traders moved from the East End Markets to the Central Market. The building was constructed of wood and iron sheets, and it was completed in June 1869. At its commencement, it opened on Tuesdays and Saturdays with 50–100 produce carts. Shops were built along the perimeter of the market and facing the streets. In the early 1880s, fish supplies were scarce in Adelaide and had to be brought from Port Augusta and Port Pirie by rail. Today, the Central Market is surrounded by the Central Market Arcade, Adelaide China Town, and Market Plaza. The 'center' of the Central Market is made up primarily of fresh produce stalls, with the perimeter and arcade shops being mainly cafés, restaurants, and variety stores. Expansion and redevelopment On 8 February 1900, a foundation stone was laid by Mayoress Rosa Ware, in the presence of the Mayor of Adelaide, Arthur Ware. Shops were added as well as a refrigeration plant for fruit and fish. Electricity was added in 1902 to replace the gas lighting. Arcade shops were added in 1915 on the eastern side. At that stage, amusements were provided such as darts, billatelle shooting galleries, ball bowling, hoop-la and cheap jacks. The addition of other businesses, such as the Hampshire Hotel in 1911, the Moore's Department stores in 1914, and Her Majesty's Theatre also attracted customers. The Market opened for trading on Tuesday, commencing April 1920. In December 1922, the fish quarters of the Market were demolished and further arcades of 32 shops were added. On 27 December 1925, the northeastern quarters of the Market were partly damaged by a fire. In 1929, butchers' licenses for the Market were not renewed because of sanitary concerns. Redevelopment of the Market commenced on 18 January 1965 with the demolition of the east end facade on Grote Street and the addition of a car park. The new market was opened on 17 June 1966 by Lord Mayor James Irwin. Prior to August 1965, the Market was known as the \"City Market,\" and after that, it was known as the \"Central Market\". Addition and demolition of supermarket Coles Supermarkets joined the neighboring Central Market Arcade in the Central Market precinct in June 1967. Further covered car parking was developed as well as the addition of a shopping complex. More than five decades later, in 2022, the supermarket was closed and demolition commenced. Construction of a hotel ( Treehouse Hotel ) will take place in 2023. Fire On 22 June 1977, the market's southern stall area was badly damaged in a fire. Major restoration was undertaken to repair the damage caused by the fire. At this time, there was new competition from local suburban shopping centers. The restoration was completed in 1987 and the damaged area was reopened by Lord Mayor James Jarvis on 14 April 1987. The market currently has 76 stalls covering some 8,000 square meters and roughly 1,000 car park spaces. Central Market Precinct Including the main Central Market building, the Central Market Precinct is composed of five separately managed areas. Adelaide Central Market The market itself holds over 76 stalls in a single undercover area. The Market is owned by the City of Adelaide and is managed by the Adelaide Central Market Authority (a subsidiary and statutory authority of the City of Adelaide), which also manages the car park above the entire precinct. Central Market Arcade Originally known as Victoria Square Arcade, the Central Market Arcade is located to the immediate east of the Central Market. The current arcade was constructed following the redevelopment of the market proper and was opened by then Premier David Tonkin on 3 November 1982; it houses over 60 specialty shops. Privately owned from its construction, the City of Adelaide assumed ownership of the arcade in September 2018 when the building's ground lease expired and began plans to completely redevelop the site into a new arcade topped with a mixed-use tower. The Market Plaza Located on the western side of the Central Market and linking it with Chinatown, the Market Plaza houses a number of specialty shops, cafes, and a food court. The Market Plaza was opened by Lord Mayor James Jarvis on 3 December 1985 and is independently owned and managed. Gouger Street Gouger Street in the Adelaide central business district is well known for its abundance of multicultural cuisine and dining establishments.

{"text": "Barlborough Hall is a Grade I listed 16th-century country house in Barlborough, Chesterfield, Derbyshire. It was built in around 1583-84 for Sir Francis Rodes and is attributed to Robert Smythson. History of the house The house was built by Sir Francis Rodes in around 1583-84, evidenced by the date 1583 on the porch and 1584 on the Great Chamber chimneypiece and is probably by Robert Smythson, designer of several of the most famous Elizabethan houses, who worked with Sir Francis's patron, the wealthy Earl of Shrewsbury. It was the seat of the Rodes baronets until their extinction in 1743 on the death of the fourth baronet, Sir John Rodes. Sir John made alterations to the house in 1696 and 1713. It then passed to the Hatfield and then Heathcote families, members of which took the Rodes surname and altered the house further in the 19th century. It remained in the family until 1935, when it was sold, and it was sold again to the Jesuits of Mount St Mary's College in 1938. A gazebo nearby was built in the 17th Century and is Grade II* listed, whilst the gatepiers and former stables are Grade II listed. The house sits in parkland which is Grade II listed on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Barlborough Hall School Barlborough Hall School was founded as an independent Catholic day school around 1939 by the Jesuits who had purchased the house in 1938.

{"text": "Mean Red Spiders are a Canadian alternative rock band from Toronto, Ontario. Their music is largely guitar-based indie rock influenced by psychedelic music. The band makes extensive use of distortion, digital keyboard loops, recorded voice samples, and effects pedals, creating a repeatable orchestrated wall of sound style with vocals. Usually categorized by some reviewers into the shoegaze, dream pop, or space rock genres. This band is not to be confused with the earlier British R&B group from Ipswich, Suffolk, of the same name (1985–1993) who issued two albums, Nude Guitarist in Wet Lettuce Frenzy (1987) and Dark Hours (1991); the punk rock band made up of members of The Chesterfield Kings; or the UK outfit performing under the same name. History The Mean Red Spiders formed in Toronto in September 1993. The original members were lead vocalist Greg Chambers, guitarist David Humphreys, drummer Don Goldrick, who named the band, and bassist Nick Andrews. They began performing in clubs and bars in Toronto. Andrews left the band soon after, and Lisa Nighswander joined to play bass and sing. In 1995, drummer Goldrick left the band, and after a few shows with Paul Boddum, Adam Rosen was hired as a replacement. That year they self-released a tape, El Diabolo. The album Places You Call Home was co-produced by Dave Newfeld with Mean Red Spiders. It was recorded in 1997 and 1998 in the basement of a rental house at Bathurst and Lawrence, and combined with some bass, guitar and drum tracks recorded by Al Forte in 1996. The album was released in 1998 by Teenage USA, and included Minesh Mandoda on keyboards, guitars, and loops. In 2000 the band released Starsandsons; this album was recorded and produced by Newfeld at Stars and Sons Studio located in Chinatown, Toronto. In 2001 the band toured in the eastern USA. Humphreys left the band, and guitarist Rob Boak (of Interstellar) joined, contributing three songs to the album Still Life Fast Moving and touring with the band in 2002. Jeff McMurrich recorded and co-produced this album in his studio at Dupont and Spadina and in the band's Pod Studio. At the time of the album's release in January 2003, Mean Red Spiders personnel were Boak, Rosen, Mandoda, Nighswander, and Chambers. Boak left the band early in 2003 and Dave Rodgers (of Neck/Christiana) joined. Humphreys later rejoined the band in 2007. Mean Red Spiders continue to record and release material, while also playing in Ghostlight, a free-form improvisational collective featuring members of Mean Red Spiders along with James Anderson and Scott Cameron.

{"text": "KrioRus () is the first cryonics company in Russia. It was founded in 2005 by the Russian Transhumanist Movement NGO. It is the only cryonic company in Europe to possess an own cryonic storage. The company offers the services of freezing the entire bodies or heads of clients in liquid nitrogen with a plan to revive them if such a technology is developed, but takes no legal obligations to do so. History KrioRus was founded in 2005 by a group of nine people who wanted to be cryogenically frozen along with their relatives to be revived in the future. Some of the company founders had past experience in the field of cryopreservation. For instance, in 2003, Igor ARyukhov was the chief advisor to the project that aimed to preserve the brain of a deceased biotechnologist. The company was established as a project run by the Russian Transhumanist Movement NGO. The same year Lydia Fedorenko became the company's first client, yet by that time KrioRus had no cryogemic storage, and Fedorenko relatives had to store her brain with solid CO². By the mid-2010s the company had clients from the United States, Netherlands, Japan, Israel, Italy, Switzerland and Australia. Several relatives of KrioRus employees were put in cryogenic storage as well. KrioRus first cryogenic storage facility was constructed in 2006 in , Solnechnogorsky District, Moscow Oblast. The second storage facility was launched in Sergiyevo-Posadsky District of Moscow Oblast in 2012. By 2016, the company planned to build another cryogenic storage near Tver and establish an R&D facility there. According to KrioRus and press reports, as of August 15, 2019 the company has 70 people under care (36 bodies and 34 patients' heads), 10 dogs, 17 cats, both male and female, as well as 4 birds and a chinchilla. In addition, there are human and animal DNA samples in storage. Almost as many as 200 Russian citizens have entered into cryopreservation agreements with the company. KrioRus is considered to be one of the largest cryonics companies in the world competing with Alcor Life Extension Foundation (170 people in cryogenic storage) and some others. In addition, KrioRus is the first cryocompany in Europe, that possesses its own cryogenic storage facility. The company has participated in a number of medical technology and funeral homes business exhibition in Russia and abroad, namely the Health Industry-2012(), Necropolis () (2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016), Necropolis-Siberia (2016), TanExpo (2016). At 2013 Necropolis exhibition, the company received the gold medal for innovations. Top management and staff Since 2009, is the current CEO of KrioRus. The former Danila Medvedev is the chairman of the board of directors and a deputy CEO for strategic development. Director for Science is the biophysicist, Igor Artyukhov. Since 2016, there are 11 people listed as company founders including Valeria Udalova, Danila Medvedev, and Igor Artyukov. The R&D team is led by cryobiologist Yuri Pichugin, PhD, who previously worked in Cryonics Institute (USA, Detroit) from 2001 to 2007. Activities KrioRus provides various services related to preservation of human and animal bodies and brains in liquid nitrogen. The company admits that the technology that would allow to \"resurrect\" cryogenically frozen people doesn't yet exist, and the success of the procedure depends entirely on the technological advancements in cryonics. The additional services include safekeeping of personal archives to help restore the clients' identities in the future. The company is incorporated in Russia and works in a relatively new and unregulated field, which allows it to provide services at lower cost than its US-based rivals. It also plans to expand to countries such as Switzerland where euthanasia is legal, thus allowing for a more simple cryogenic conservation process. KrioRus R&F facilities are located in Moscow and in Voronezh and work on improving of frosting and defrosting methods and technologies. The company collaborates with the Russian and other cryonics companies in the field of reversible organ deep-freeze technologies. Legal aspects Legally speaking, the contract between KrioRus and its clients is designed as an agreement to participate in a scientific experiment, hence the customers have to accept the risks associated and acknowledge that the \"revival\" is not guaranteed. The contract covers the preservation of the bodies for up to 100 years. As KrioRus has a legal status of a scientific institution, its activities are not subject to certification. Criticism Yevgeny Alexandrov, the chair of the Russian Academy of Sciences commission against pseudoscience, has said that there is no scientific basis for cryonics and that the company's offering is based on unfounded speculations.

{"text": "Teesport is a large sea port located in the unitary authority of Redcar and Cleveland, in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire, Northern England. Owned by PD Ports, it is located approximately inland from the North Sea and east of Middlesbrough on the River Tees. Teesport is currently the third largest port in the United Kingdom, and amongst the ten biggest in Western Europe, handling over 56 million tonnes of domestic and international cargo per year. Description The port covers an area of of land alongside the southern bank of the River Tees. Presently handling over 6,000 ships and 56 million tonnes of cargo per annum, Teesport is mostly associated with the handling of steel, petrochemical, manufacturing, engineering and retail. Teesport is the logistical hub for the commodity chemical and steel companies that are members of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC). Facilities Teesport's facilities include: Tees Dock Terminal: handling bulk cargo, which accounts for 73% of the port's volume. Redcar Ore Terminal: deep-sea bulk terminal facility that handles more than eight million tons of imports a year, mainly iron ore Cleveland Potash bulk terminal: handles more than a million tons of potash and salt exports, mainly from Boulby Mine Steel Export Terminal: equipped with eight gantry cranes, it handles over a million tons of steel slab export a year. Can also handle wood imports, including tropical hardwood, fiberboard, plus softwood and pulp from Scandinavia Teesport Container Terminals: two computerised Container quays, capable of handling 500,000 TEU per annum TCT1 at , which can hold 1,872 TEU at quayside TCT2 at , specifically developed deep-sea cargo quay which presently handles customers including CMA CGM. TCT2 has its own specifically built railhead, which was developed in partnership with DB Cargo UK Roll-on/roll-off: P&O Ferries operates eight sailings to Rotterdam and six to Zeebrugge per week. An extension of allows the import of 100,000 cars by Renault, while General Motors sub-leases Dawson's Wharf: handles dry cargo from a river-facing quay, handling 400 thousand tonnes of bulk minerals and non-hazardous chemicals Cochrane's Wharf: a site operated by Tarmac Aggregates for the import of dredged marine materials Landside Landside clients include Hanson plc who operate a major cement works, and a landfill site which uses non-hazardous waste to backfill the site of the former Tees Dock facility. Tesco operate a high-bay non-food storage and distribution facility at Teesport. The currently under-construction Teesport Renewable Energy Plant is scheduled to come into operation in 2020. Northern Gateway Terminal In February 2008, PD Ports were given planning permission to redevelop the former Shell Oil refinery in a £350 million scheme that would create a new container facility, entitled the Northern Gateway Terminal, which would raise TEU capacity of the entire port to 1.5 million TEU. However, due to the 2008 economic downturn, PD Ports put back the start of development until 2010 at the earliest, with the programme now scheduled to complete in 2020. Transport connections PD Ports leases a number of former-British Rail Class 08 shunting locomotives from RMS Locotec to move rail traffic around the port, and to/from the two main associated marshalling yards. The port is directly rail connected to the East Coast Main Line and the Durham Coast Line, and close to the A66 trans-pennine route, and other major trunk roads. History The first developed facility on the current Teesport location was a Royal Navy depot during World War I. This allowed the allocated six British E-class submarines to operate further into the North Sea during their defence, attack and mine laying operations against the Imperial German Navy. At this time, commercial port facilities were still handled at Middlesbrough Docks, located further upstream. In the 1920s, Eston Urban District Council decided to turn the 13 former dormitories of the former Royal Navy facility into 38 small houses, within a community called Teesport. By the start of World War II, of the original 130 residents that came when the community was developed, only 3 remained. This was because in 1934, the joint owners of the land on which the community was built – riverside and shoreline Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson; landside Dorman Long – had written to the council to seek assurances that they would not let any more houses within the community, so allowing the land owners to take back possession and be allowed to develop their businesses on the land. After the war, due to over-crowding around the original Port Darlington and Middlesbrough Docks facility, both companies developed industrial facilities on the land, and sub-leased some land to other commercial operations. Between 1965 and 1968, three oil refineries were developed close to Teesport, thanks to the Phillips Petroleum's development of the Ekofisk oil field in the North Sea. The first two were jointly developed and operated by Phillips and ICI on the north shore of the River Tees at the North Tees Works, just south of Greatham Creek. After processing this facility fed cyclohexane, benzene, toluene and xylene to ICI's chemical plants at Billingham and Wilton. The third refinery was developed in 1968 by Shell Oil on the south shore within Teesport. This facility was served by what became known as Tees Dock, with the whole docks facility designed around Panamax scale ships. In 1980, with the discovery of North Sea gas, a pipeline was installed between Ekofisk and Seal Sands on the north shore. Although the Shell refinery was mothballed in 1989 and later closed, and the north shore facility of Petroplus closed in 2010, as a result of the pipeline petrochemicals traffic still today represents about 50% of the cargo through Teesport, around 26 million tonnes a year. In 1992 the Port Authority of Tees and Hartlepool was privatised, with the original three buyers subsequently reduced to a single owner, Powell Duffryn Plc, in 1995. With traffic out-scaling the port's handling and ship-scale facilities, PD Ports then developed TCT2 in 2002 specifically as a deep-sea cargo quay on top of the site that used to be the original Tees Dock. In March 2021, Teesport became the UK's largest Freeport.

{"text": "The SB-33 is a small Italian minimum metal blast type anti-personnel mine formerly manufactured by Misar, that entered service in 1977. The SB-33 can be emplaced by hand or scattered using the helicopter mounted SY-AT system. The body of the mine is made of two glass reinforced polycarbonate halves, with the top surface having a central neoprene pressure pad. The body has an irregular shape to make the mine harder to distinguish on the ground. To arm an SB-33, a small pin is removed from the side of the mine. After the mine has been armed, gradual pressure on the pressure plate (i.e. when the victim steps on it) rotates a locking collar until the striker is released, which flips into a stab-detonator and the mine explodes. However, sudden pressure (e.g. from a mine-clearing charge) causes the striker to lock the rotating collar in position for the duration of the pressure, preventing the mine from detonating. The combination of low metal content and resistance to overpressure make the mine extremely difficult to remove. Another version of the SB-33 called the SB-33AR (AR standing for Anti-Rimozione, \"Counter-Removal\") exists. It looks identical to the standard SB-33 mine. However, the SB-33AR has an integral anti-handling device specifically designed to injure deminers. The anti-handling device in an SB-33AR consists of a mercury tilt switch and battery connected to the detonator. When an SB-33AR is moved a few degrees from the horizontal (i.e. when a deminer lifts it), it detonates, blowing the victim's hand off. Generally, a small number of SB-33AR landmines would be sown inside a minefield containing standard SB-33 mines in order to hinder and deter any attempt to conduct demining operations. Copies of the mine were produced in several countries and the mine was in service with the Netherlands, Spain, Greece and Argentina. This mine is no longer produced and Italy has destroyed all operational stocks and any associated machinery required for its manufacture. However, uncleared minefields containing SB-33 mines do exist e.g. in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Iran, Iraq, Kurdistan, and the Western Sahara. Specifications Diameter: 85 mm Height: 30 mm Operating pressure: 8 kg Weight: 140 g Explosive content: 35 g RDX/HMX (98%/2%) Variants EM-20, a Greek copy of the mine. M/412, a Portuguese copy of the mine. P-5, a Spanish copy of the mine produced under license. It is no longer in service with Spain, and all but 4,000 of the mines have been destroyed.

Biography Robert de Visée's place and date of birth are unknown. He probably knew Francesco Corbetta and would have been familiar with his music. claimed that he studied with Corbetta and this information has been repeated uncritically in later sources including Strizich and Ledbetter 2001. It is however unsupported by any documentary evidence . He is first mentioned (by Le Gallois) in 1680, and at about that time became a chamber musician to Louis XIV, in which capacity he often performed at court. In 1709 he was appointed as a singer in the royal chamber, and in 1719 he was named 'Guitar Master of the King' (Maître de Guitare du Roi) to Louis XV, the ten-year-old great-grandson of Louis XIV who succeeded to the throne in 1715. Jean Rousseau reported in a letter of 1688 that Visée was a respected musician at Versailles, and also played the viol . The last payment in his name in state documents is dated 1732. It is to be assumed that he died about that time. () Works Visée published two books of guitar music that contain twelve suites between them, as well as a few separate pieces: Livre de guitare dédié au roi (Paris, 1682) and Livre de pièces pour la guitare (Paris, 1686). He also published a collection of pieces for the theorbo and lute: Pièces de théorbe et de luth (Paris, 1716); these are in staff notation rather than tablature and may also be performed as ensemble pieces.

History The village of Collevecchio probably grew up on the piane before moving to its current hilltop location. Around 1927 a small church was constructed in the name of Saint Emygdius, under the supervision of architect Pio Ferretti. His brother Gregorio later served as priest in the church. In spite of this, in 1945 Gregorio was shot by local partisans for his support of the Fascists. Located in Piane di Collevecchio is an old water mill constructed in 1867 by Angelo Giuseppe and Francesco Salvi. Various members of the Salvi family kept the mill in operation until the year 1962. Today it is used mostly for school visits and educational purposes. Economy In 1989 springs containing salt and sulphurous waters were uncovered in this area. These thermal baths have received recognition from the local Italian Ministry and a large tourist centre devoted to their enjoyment has been planned. Such a development should bring much needed economic development to the surrounding area. Monastery At one time the ancient Monastery of Santa Maria was located in a deep hollow known as \"Fosso dello Zolfo\" (Sulphur Ditch). It must have been constructed on a very steep incline near the Vomano river. A neighborhood in this locality is still known as Santa Maria, referred to by others as San Martino. Over time the forces of erosion have washed away virtually all traces of this small church although some of the elderly residents of Piane di Collevecchio still speak of its presence. From time to time people who happen to be excavating in the area come across traces of the church, these thought to be omens of good luck. Festivals and events One prominent tradition in this hamlet is linked to memory of Saint Anthony. Groups of young people dress in the historical costumes and go from house to house singing traditional songs. In return, local food delicacies such as sausage, cheese, and eggs are requested. Another custom involves a game called rutula (the dialect word for ruzzola, meaning to roll). Spheres of wood or rubber (in the past cheese) are placed in the pouch of a sheppard's sling and hurled far through the air. Tournaments dedicated to this pastime are still held and an Italian rutula champion was recently crowned.

{"text": "Crymlyn Bog () is a nature reserve and a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest of international significance, near Swansea, south Wales. It is the largest area of lowland fen in Wales and lies immediately to the eastern side of Kilvey Hill just north of the industrial area of Crymlyn Burrows. Plantlife found in the bog is more typical of that found in East Anglia. Habitats range from swamps, carr (fen), water meadows and tall reed beds to waterlogged scrub consisting mainly of willow, where wetter areas merge with woodland. There are a number of plants found in the wetland that are rare in Great Britain. Examples of these include the slender cotton grass and lesser water plantain. In 2003, surveys of Crymlyn Bog, Pant-y-Sais Fen and the inter-connecting wetlands identified the area as one of only three locations in the UK at which the fen raft spider is found. The extent of the population is unknown but the quality of habitat at the site is considered good enough for the population to be stable. The reserve is a haven for birds. Predatory visitors like the hen harrier, buzzard, hobby and the occasional marsh harrier visit the site regularly. The site provides an important refuge for a range of wetland birds like the bittern, water rail, sedge and reed warblers, bearded tit and grey heron, which can often be seen or heard there. There is a visitor centre in the bog, which is frequented by nature and bird watching enthusiasts. History In previous inter-glacial periods the estuary of the River Clydach and River Neath once flowed through the valley now occupied by the wetland complex. Crymlyn Bog is an historic boundary between 'South' and 'West Wales', between the lordships of Glamorgan and Gower, and between the medieval and modern (i.e. until 1923) dioceses of St. David's and Llandaff. Part of the land was previously owned by a BP oil refinery where oil from the refinery spilt out into the wetland changing its ecology. Crymlyn Bog was largely owned by the CEGB who used the fen to dump waste PFA and in this same area Swansea City Council used it as a landfill site. Small parts were owned by the Neath and Tennant Canal Company and some sections of the canal are still clear of emergent vegetation. With the surrounding industrialisation, encroaching residential districts and a polluting landfill site beside it, it was uncertain that the bog would survive. Andrew Lees, who later became Campaigns Director of Friends of the Earth started a campaign with the Swansea branch of FoE to protect the bog. On an eastern limb of the bog is Pant-y-Sais fen, where there is a memorial to Mr Lees, which carries a quotation from him: \"At some point I had to stand up and be counted. Who speaks for the butterflies?\" References External links JNCC: Crymlyn Bog Site Kilvey Hill and Crymlyn Bog Countryside Council for Wales: Crymlyn Bog Swansea Green Map: Crymlyn Bog and Visitor Centre Crymlyn Bog www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Crymlyn Bog and surrounding area Bogs of Wales Wetlands of Neath Port Talbot Sites of Special Scientific Interest in West Glamorgan Nature reserves in Neath Port Talbot National nature reserves in Wales Ramsar sites in Wales"}

Description The cap is 1.5 — 2(2.5) cm and hemispheric to convex to companulate. The margin is incurved when young, clay-colored, often reddish brown towards the disc, hygrophanous, smooth, and grayish to greenish; it is translucent-striate at the margin when wet. It becomes blue when bruised. The gills are adnexed, distinctly mottled, and dully grayish with blackish spots. The stipe is 5–12 cm long, 2–3 mm thick, hollow, and vertically striate. It is blackish towards the base, greyish towards the apex, and pallid to whitish fibrils run the length of the stipe. The stipe is equal to slightly swollen at the base and lacks a partial veil. Panaeolus tropicalis spores are dark violet to jet black, ellipsoid, and 10.5–12.0 x 7–9 µm. The basidia each produce two spores. Like many other hallucinogenic mushrooms, this fungus readily bruises blue where it is handled. It can be differentiated from Panaeolus cyanescens by microscopic characteristics. Distribution and habitat Panaeolus tropicalis is a mushroom that grows on dung. It is most often found in Hawaii, Central Africa, and Cambodia; it can also be found in Mexico, Tanzania, the Philippines, Florida, and Japan.

He is a senior research fellow in the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences, and Humanities at Cambridge University, Director of the Press Fellowship Programme at Wolfson College, Cambridge, Emeritus Professor of the Public Understanding of Technology at the British Open University, adjunct professor at University College, Cork and the Technology columnist of the London Observer newspaper. Personal background John Naughton was born in 1946 in Ballina, County Mayo. He was educated at University College, Cork, and at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, UK. He now lives and works in Cambridge, UK. Intellectual background Starting as an electrical engineer who worked in systems modelling and analysis, Naughton subsequently developed an interest in the public understanding of technology and—later—in the social, political, and cultural impact of internet technology. Academic career The Open University Naughton joined the Open University as a lecturer in Systems in 1972. He has made contributions (see e.g.) to the understanding and application of soft systems analysis developed by Peter Checkland at Lancaster University. In addition to his work in systems analysis Naughton also made significant contributions to the public understanding of technology, initially as co-designer (with Professor Nigel Cross) of two incarnations of the University's Technology Foundation Course (T101 & T102) which, over its lifetime, introduced over 50,000 students to technological ideas. In the 1980s he was a key member of the team that introduced the use of personal computers into the University's teaching and learning system. In the 1990s, with colleagues Martin Weller and Garry Alexander, Naughton created the University's first major online course (You, your computer and the Net) which attracted 12,000 students per presentation in its early days and marked the beginning of the University's rise as a major provider of online education. (It now has approximately 250,000 online students.) In 2001 he set up the University's Relevant Knowledge programme—a suite of short online courses on topical technological issues and was Director of the programme until 2009. Naughton was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1980 and became Professor of the Public Understanding of Technology in July 2002. He retired from the Open University in 2011 and was appointed Emeritus Professor. Other academic activities In 1991, Naughton was elected a Fellow of Wolfson College, Cambridge and in 1996 became Director of the college's Press Fellowship Programme, which brings journalists in mid-career from all over the world to Cambridge for a term to research a project of their own supervision. To date, the Programme has welcomed over 310 journalists from 46 countries. In 2008, he was appointed Academic Adviser to the Arcadia Project at Cambridge University Library. This was a project, sponsored by the Arcadia Fund, to explore the role of the academic library in a digital age. The project ran from 2008 to 2012 and supported 19 Arcadia Fellows and their associated projects. He was Vice-President of Wolfson College, Cambridge from 2011 to 2015. Current research In collaboration with Professor Sir Richard Evans and Dr David Runciman, Naughton is a Principal Investigator on a five-year research project on 'Conspiracy and Democracy' funded by the Leverhulme Trust. He is also co-Director (with Professor David Runciman) of the 'Technology and Democracy' project in the Cambridge Centre for Digital Knowledge. Both projects are based in CRASSH (the Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences, and Humanities) at Cambridge University. Naughton is chair of the advisory board of Cambridge's Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy Naughton is also a member of the Steering Group of the University's Strategic Research Initiative on Big Data. Journalistic career In the early 1970s, Naughton wrote for the political and cultural weekly, the New Statesman, mainly covering scientific issues. Between 1982 and 1987 he was Television Critic of The Listener, a weekly magazine published by the BBC which ceased publication in 1991. In 1987 he succeeded the novelist Julian Barnes as Television Critic of the London Observer, and held that post until mid-1995. During that time he won the 'Critic of the Year' award three times.

{"text": "Rabbi Menachem Ziemba (1883–1943) () was a distinguished pre-World War II Rabbi, known as a Talmudic genius and prodigy. He is known to be fluent in all of Talmud as well as many of the works of the later Rabbis such as Rabbi Joseph Rosen and Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk. He was gunned down by the Germans in the Warsaw Ghetto. Biography Rabbi Ziemba was born in Praga, a suburb of Warsaw, in 1883. His father, Elazar, died while Menachem was still a young boy and the orphan was brought up by his grandfather Rabbi Avraham Ziemba. Rabbi Avraham had been a chassid of the Kotzker Rebbe and a student of the Chiddushei Harim, and was now a follower of the Sfas Emes of Gur. Rabbi Ziemba was brought up in the Gerrer chasidus by his grandfather and remained a loyal chasid his entire life. Even years later when he was world-renowned as a Torah scholar, Posek and master of Hasidic thought, he still considered himself a simple Chasid of the rebbe of Ger. When he visited Ger, he was called by his first name and refused to sit at the Rebbe's top table, an honour reserved for visitors of note. As Rabbi Ziemba grew up in Warsaw, he gained a reputation as a formidable Talmid Chacham (scholar) and dazzling genius. He maintained a unique correspondence with the Gaon of Rogatchov, a fiery individual not known for his tolerance of mediocrity, nor tolerance of younger students. At the age of eighteen, Rabbi Ziemba married the daughter of a wealthy local merchant. He was thus able to learn Torah unhindered for the next twenty years, a time remembered by him as the happiest years of his life. His fame spread further afield, attracting the attention of Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk and others. He once confided that he authored more than 10,000 pages of Torah novellae during this golden period. When his father-in-law died, Rabbi Ziemba found it necessary to help out in the former's store in order to continue supporting his family. He rejected numerous offers to serve as rabbi in many towns and cities, including Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem and Rabbi of Lublin, saying that he had more time to study while working than as a communal rabbi. However, at the request of his beloved Gerrer Rebbe, Rabbi Ziemba entered communal affairs. He was appointed the representative of Praga to the Kehilla Council in Warsaw in 1935. Between 1930 and 1935, the world economic depression affected Rabbi Ziemba. His store was forced to close. He was offered the prestigious position of Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, but turned it down. After the untimely death of Rabbi Meir Shapiro, Rabbi Ziemba was offered the position as his successor as both Rabbi of Lublin and rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin. For unknown reasons, this never came to pass. In 1935 he, together with Rabbi Yaakov Myer Biderman, brother-in-law of the Gerrer Rebbe, and Rabbi Avraham Weinberg, was appointed to the Warsaw Rabbinate, becoming one of the foremost spokesmen for Orthodox Jewry in Poland. Aside from his newfound political prominence, Rabbi Ziemba became a Halachic decisor of great importance, answering questions from around the world, as well as from Poland. Rabbi Ziemba also took an active role in the Agudas Yisroel at an early stage. At its first Knessia Gedola (great gathering), he was not yet forty when chosen to serve as honorary secretary in the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. At the second Knessia Gedola, Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzenski agreed to serve as chairman of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah only if Rabbi Ziemba would continue in his position, while the forty-five-year-old Rabbi Ziemba felt himself to be too young and sought to stay in the background. At the third Knessiah Gedolah in 1937 in Marienbad, Austria, which played witness to the last massive gathering of European Orthodoxy before the Holocaust, Rabbi Ziemba was at the height of his fame. He spoke twice to the full assemblage and each time was greeted with hushed silence and awe. World War II In January 1943, in a meeting of the Warsaw Jewish leadership, Rabbi Ziemba proclaimed that traditional martyrdom (Kiddush HaShem-Sanctification of the Divine Name) was no longer an option as a response to German persecution. He stated that \"sanctification of the Divine Name\" must be done through resistance to the enemy. He said to a group of ghetto leaders, “In the present we are faced by an arch foe, whose unparalleled ruthlessness and total annihilation purposes know no bounds. Halachah [Jewish law] demands that we fight and resist to the very end with unequaled determination and valor for the sake of Sanctification of the Divine Name.”With the outbreak of World War II and the German invasion of Poland, Rabbi Ziemba became the single most important force in the Warsaw Ghetto. In the darkest days of despair, he was a source of hope, optimism and inspiration. He set up secret locations for the study of Torah, and at great personal risk, constantly visited these clandestine places to strengthen those who studied there. His wife died in the ghetto. Rabbi Ziemba was one of the few rabbinic leader who called for armed resistance. He redefined traditional martyrdom \"Kiddush HaShem\" as \"Kiddush Ha'Chaim\", the sanctification of life. According to scholar Pesach Schindler, Rabbi Ziemba summarized his idea of Kiddush Ha'Chaim when he begged for the Jews to resist right before the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in April 1943:‘Thus, by the authority of the Torah of Israel, I insist that there is absolutely no purpose nor any value of Kiddush Hashem inherent in the death of a Jew. Kiddush Hashem in our present situation is embodied in the will of a Jew to live. This struggle for aspiration and longing for life is a mitzvah to be realized by means of nekamah, vengeance, mesiras nefesh, and the sanctification of the mind and will.’Rabbi Ziemba was given two opportunities to escape from the ghetto. Through the efforts of Chaim Israel and the Sternbuch family of Switzerland, he was sent a Costa Rican passport and citizenship papers. His last name, however, was misspelled—Ziember instead of Ziemba. This was enough excuse for his papers to be declared void. In another incident, Rabbi Ziemba, along with the other two surviving members of the Warsaw Rabbinate, Rabbi Shimshon Sztokhamer and Rabbi David Shapiro, were suddenly summoned to the Judenrat. They were told that the Catholic Church was willing to rescue them. The three refused to go, saying that the existence of the Rabbinate gave Jews strength to carry on, although such a formality was no longer needed. Rabbi Ziemba established a committee to provide Pesach supplies for the Ghetto inhabitants. He was under constant surveillance by the authorities, and as such, could not become personally involved with the Ghetto underground. However, when money was needed to obtain ammunition, he was the first to donate, and added personal blessings to this resistance movement. He was one of the last three remaining rabbis in the Warsaw Ghetto with Rabbi Shimshon Sztokhamer (Samson Stockhammer) and Rabbi David Shapiro. Shortly before the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising began the Archbishop of Warsaw offered the three rabbis refuge in his palace. After a brief discussion all three refused the offer, not wanting to abandon the Jews of the ghetto. Death The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising began soon before Pesach. While the battle raged around him, Rabbi Ziemba prepared himself for the coming holiday as if nothing was happening. In the evening, the fighting stopped and Ziemba conducted the Seder as though the times were normal. The next few days were spent in hideouts watching the ghetto being burned. The Germans were methodically destroying the ghetto, house by house, in order to break the resistance. Among those burning were the houses around Kupiecka 7, including the building where Ziemba was holed up. With the air thick with smoke and nearly impossible to breathe, Ziemba and the people with him decided to try to run across the street, past SS men manning machine guns, to the building where the \"Volia Rav\", Rabbi Ber, was hiding. During a momentary lull in the shooting, when it seemed safe, Ziemba's daughter Rosa managed to run across first and then motioned to the others with her arm. Her signal was misunderstood. Believing it to be safe, Ziemba, holding his five-year-old grandson Yankele Ber by the hand, tried to make a run for dear life. Wild screams and gunfire ensued. Ziemba fell to the floor; the others retreated under the ferocious assault. The news of the Rabbi's death quickly spread to all neighboring hideouts. In spite of the great danger, a number of minyanim gathered. A Beth Din was set up, which decided to bury the Rabbi temporarily in a grave in the courtyard of Kupiecka 4. When the ghetto was finally liquidated, his entire immediate family was taken to Treblinka where they all perished. Postscript In 1958, upon learning that the Polish Government was planning to rebuild the area of the ghetto that included Rabbi Ziemba's grave, his nephews Rabbi Avraham and Rabbi Yitzchok Meir Ziemba (who were with him to the very end) and others expended great efforts to exhume his body and bring it to Israel. After weeks of work by surveyors and others, his grave was finally located—all landmarks remembered by the survivors had been destroyed in the interim. His body was flown to Israel and after a funeral attended by all the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah and tens of thousands of people, he was finally laid to rest on Har HaMenuchot. Works Totzos Chaim, a work on the laws pertaining to carrying on Shabbos, written in honour of Rabbi Ziemba's father-in-law who died in 1920 Zera Avraham (seed of Abraham), a correspondence between Rabbi Ziemba and Rabbi Avraham Luftiber of Warsaw, son in law of Rav Meir Simcha of Dvinsk who died at a very young age.

He wrote works on the Sifra and Sifri and they are called Otzar Hasifra and Otzar Hasifri. Tens of thousands of pages of works authored by Rabbi Ziemba were destroyed in the burning of the Warsaw Ghetto. Among these was a treatise on the entire Rambam called Machaze Hamelech, another on the Talmud Yerushalmi called Menachem Yerushalaim, as well as hundreds of responsa and novellae on Bavli, Shulchan Aruch, Midrash and many other parts of the Torah.

{"text": "Singapore is a ghost town in Michigan, United States. It was a casualty of erosion after the surrounding woods were deforested—exacerbated by the need for lumber to rebuild several Midwestern cities and towns ravaged by fires in 1871. Its ruins now lie buried beneath the sand dunes of the Lake Michigan shoreline at the mouth of the Kalamazoo River in Saugatuck Township, near the cities of Saugatuck and Douglas in Allegan County. It was founded in 1836 by New York land speculator Oshea Wilder, who was hoping to build a port town to rival Chicago and Milwaukee. At its height, the town boasted of three mills, two hotels, several general stores, and a bank, and was home to Michigan's first schoolhouse. In total, the town consisted of 23 buildings and two sawmills. Bank scandal In 1838, two short-lived \"wildcat\" banks were established in Allegan County: the Bank of Allegan and the Bank of Singapore. They both issued their own banknotes and were required to hold enough hard currency (specie) to cover at least 1/3 of the circulating banknotes. However, neither Singapore nor Allegan was at that level. By 1838, over $50,000 in Singapore notes had been placed in circulation. Shortly after the Civil War, Singapore and many other Michigan banks were involved in a bank scandal. Inspectors required them to produce the specie to support their notes and when they were unable to do so they were dissolved. From time to time collectors come across notes issued by the Singapore Bank. There are a few known full sheets of the notes before they were cut into individual notes, sometimes signed and sometimes unsigned by the bank president or authorized personnel at the time. 40-day blizzard The 40-Day Blizzard of 1842 might very well have wiped out the people of Singapore, had it not been for the shipwreck of the Milwaukie, laden with barrelled flour, just off its shore. Several barrels washed ashore and fed the people of Singapore until the blizzard blew over. Change of ownership Wilder deserted the town in 1846, moving back to Calhoun County. James Carter of New York bought out Wilder's interest in the town and moved there to oversee his investment. It was only two years after that that Carter sold the town to his brother, Artemas, and Francis B. Stockbridge. Artemas was more innovative than his brother, and very soon after arriving, he and Stockbridge built the first three-masted schooner on Lake Michigan, dubbed the Octavia, to carry lumber from Singapore to Chicago. Carter was bought out by Stockbridge in 1850 and the decade proved to be one of prosperity for Stockbridge and the town, which boasted a population of several hundred people by 1871. Singapore's demise After the fires swept through Chicago, Holland, Peshtigo, and Manistee in late 1871, the area around Singapore was almost completely deforested supplying lumber for rebuilding. Without the protective tree cover, the winds and sands coming off Lake Michigan quickly eroded the town into ruins and within four years had completely covered it. The town was vacated by 1875. Today, Singapore lives on only in the name of the Singapore Yacht Club, which is at one end of town. Just as the \"cow kicking over the lantern\" story was born out of the Great Chicago Fire, this event also gave birth to a legend. The story persists that one resident of Singapore refused to move, even as the sand enveloped his home. Eventually, he had to enter and leave the dwelling by a second-floor window, and he stayed until the sand reached the roof.

{"text": "San-nakji () is a variety of hoe (raw dish) made with long arm octopus (Octopus minor), a small octopus species called nakji in Korean and is sometimes translated into \"baby octopus\" due to its relatively small size compared to the giant octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini). The octopuses are most commonly killed before being cut into small pieces and served, with the nerve activity in the octopus' tentacles making the pieces move posthumously on the plate while served. The octopus' highly complex nervous system, with two-thirds of its neurons localised in the nerve cords of its arms, lets the octopus show a variety of reflex actions that persist even when they have no input from the brain. Less commonly, a live octopus is eaten whole. The dish is sprinkled with sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds. Language difference Vocabularies in the two Koreas differ on nakji: South Koreans call Octopus minor, a small kind of octopus (often mistranslated as \"baby octopus\") nakji, while North Koreans call a squid nakji (nakchi in McCune–Reischauer romanization). Choking hazard Consuming sannakji is potentially dangerous due to choking hazard, especially for diners who are intoxicated. Because the cephalopod's limbs contain neurons, the extremities continue to move and the suction cups along its tentacles maintain their gripping power that might attach to one's throat, even after getting detached from the body and doused with sesame oil. Several incidents of choking on sannakji have been reported, one in 2008 in Gwangju and at least one death in 2010. Prevalence Sannakji is served in Korean restaurants that serve sliced raw fish, but it also can be found at bars as a snack to accompany alcoholic beverages, such as soju.

{"text": "Yorkshire Electricity was an electricity distribution utility in England, serving much of Yorkshire and parts of Derbyshire, Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire. History Formed as the Yorkshire Electricity Board in 1948 as part of the nationalisation of the electricity industry by the Electricity Act 1947. The establishment of the company involved the amalgamation of 50 private and local authority power companies. The Yorkshire Electricity Board took over Scarcroft Lodge in north Leeds as its headquarters. Nationalised industry The Yorkshire Electricity Board was responsible for the purchase of electricity from the electricity generator (the Central Electricity Generating Board from 1958) and its distribution and sale of electricity to customers. The key people on the board were chairman Arthur Bond (1964, 1967), deputy chairman R. H. M. Barkham (1964, 1967), and full-time member J. S. Yates (1964, 1967). The total number of customers supplied by the board was: The amount of electricity, in GWh, sold by Yorkshire Electricity Board was: Post privatisation Yorkshire Electricity Board was privatised in 1990 as the Yorkshire Electricity Group plc. In June 1993, Homepower stores were opened across the Yorkshire region. Homepower was the retail arm of the company which was a joint venture with East Midlands Electricity. At its peak, Homepower employed 900 people and had 130 stores. This part of the company was sold off in 1996. In 1997 the company was acquired by American Electric Power (AEP) and Public Service Company of Colorado (part of Xcel Energy) in a deal worth £1.5 billion. In 2001 Innogy plc bought 94.75% of the company in a deal worth £1.8 billion. The company was subsequently split into two entities, one a supply company, the other a distribution utility. The distribution company (Yorkshire Electricity Distribution Limited) was disposed of to CE Electric UK in 2001 in exchange for the supply business of Northern Electric. Northern Powergrid is now the licensed distribution network operator for the Yorkshire region. In 2002, the company divested itself of its Leeds Headquarters as most staff and processes had been transferred to the Midlands headquarters of npower by that time. Innogy was itself taken over by RWE. The supply company now trades as npower.

Club career Parma Born in Aversa, Campania region, Ruopolo started his career at Emilia–Romagna side Parma. He was the member of Primavera under-20 team and in 2002 made his professional debut with Pro Patria of Serie C1, where he was sent on loan for a season. He was then loaned to Cittadella, again in Serie C1, where he scored six goals. On 1 July 2004, he returned to Parma, playing 21 games (9 in the UEFA Cup, 1 in the Coppa Italia, and 1 in the relegation playoffs) without scoring any goals; however noted by FC Lokomotiv Moscow, that signs him on loan for the 2005 Russian season. He played seven Russian league matches for Lokomotiv, made two substitution appearances in UEFA Champions League third qualifying round, and started 4 games and made 2 substitution appearances in UEFA Cup, scored two goals against S.K.

Atalanta Bergamo was relegated from Serie A in May 2010 and had sold numbers of players to AlbinoLeffe in previous seasons. In the 2010–11 season, Ruopolo played 31 matches and scored 8 times for the Dea. In May 2012, Atalanta received two penalty points and a €25,000 fine as several players, including Ruopolo, had been accused of match fixing. Padova & football scandal In July 2011, Ruopolo was moved to Calcio Padova on free transfer. He was banned for 16 months after plea bargain for involvement in 2011–12 Italian football scandal. He was released by Padova in July 2012.

{"text": "Our Lady of the Rocks is one of the two islets off the coast of Perast in the Bay of Kotor, Montenegro (the other being Sveti Đorđe island). It is an artificial island created by bulwark of rocks and by sinking old and seized ships loaded with rocks. The Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Rocks (Montenegrin: Gospa od Škrpjela) is the largest building on the islet, and has a museum attached to it. There is also a small gift shop close to the church and a navigation light at the western end of the islet. According to legend, the islet was made over the centuries by local seamen who kept an ancient oath after finding the icon of Madonna and Child on the rock in the sea on 22 July 1452. Upon returning from each successful voyage, they laid a rock in the Bay. Over time, the islet gradually emerged from the sea. The custom of throwing rocks into the sea is alive even nowadays. Every year on the sunset of 22 July, an event called fašinada in the local dialect, when local residents take their boats and throw rocks into the sea, widening the surface of the island, takes place. The church was renovated in 1722. The church contains 68 paintings by Tripo Kokolja, a famous 17th-century baroque artist from Perast. His most important painting, ten meters long, is The Death of the Virgin. There are also paintings by Italian artists, and an icon (circa 1452) of Our Lady of the Rocks, by Lovro Dobričević of Kotor. The church also houses a collection of silver votive tablets and a famous votive tapestry embroidered by Jacinta Kunić-Mijović from Perast. It took her 25 years to finish it while waiting for her darling to return from a long journey, and eventually, she became blind. She used golden and silver fibres but what makes this tapestry so famous is the fact that she also embroidered her own hair in it.

{"text": "The Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment is a China-based multinational particle physics project studying neutrinos, in particular neutrino oscillations. The multinational collaboration includes researchers from China, Chile, the United States, Taiwan (Republic of China), Russia, and the Czech Republic. The US side of the project is funded by the US Department of Energy's Office of High Energy Physics. It is situated at Daya Bay, approximately 52 kilometers northeast of Hong Kong and 45 kilometers east of Shenzhen. There is an affiliated project in the Aberdeen Tunnel Underground Laboratory in Hong Kong. The Aberdeen lab measures the neutrons produced by cosmic muons which may affect the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment. The experiment consists of eight antineutrino detectors, clustered in three locations within of six nuclear reactors. Each detector consists of 20 tons of liquid scintillator (linear alkylbenzene doped with gadolinium) surrounded by photomultiplier tubes and shielding. A much larger follow-up is in development in the form of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) in Kaiping, which will use an acrylic sphere filled with 20,000 tons of liquid scintillator to detect reactor antineutrinos. Groundbreaking began 10 January 2015, with operation expected in 2020. Neutrino oscillations The experiment studies neutrino oscillations and is designed to measure the mixing angle θ13 using antineutrinos produced by the reactors of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant and the Ling Ao Nuclear Power Plant. Scientists are also interested in whether neutrinos violate Charge-Parity conservation. On 8 March 2012, the Daya Bay collaboration announced a 5.2σ discovery of θ13 ≠ 0, with This significant result represents a new type of oscillation and is surprisingly large. It is consistent with earlier, less significant results by T2K, MINOS and Double Chooz. With θ13 so large, NOνA has about a 50% probability of being sensitive to the neutrino mass hierarchy. Experiments may also be able to probe CP violation among neutrinos. The collaboration produced an updated analysis of their results in 2014, which used the energy spectrum to improve the bounds on the mixing angle: An independent measurement was also published using events from neutrons captured on hydrogen: . Daya Bay has used its data to search for signals of a light sterile neutrino, resulting in exclusions of some previous unexplored mass regions. At the Moriond 2015 physics conference a new best fit for mixing angle and mass difference was presented: On 21 April 2023 (published), Daya Bay's reports the following precision measurements: for the normal mass ordering or , for the inverted mass ordering. The Daya Bay collaboration suggests, \"The reported will likely remain the most precise measurement of in the foreseeable future and be crucial to the investigation of the mass hierarchy and CP violation in neutrino oscillation.\" Antineutrino spectrum Daya Bay Collaboration measured the anti-neutrino energy spectrum, and found that anti-neutrinos at an energy of around 5 MeV are in excess relative to theoretical expectations. This unexpected disagreement between observation and predictions suggested that the Standard model of particle physics needs improvement.

History The Cup's inaugural showing was a standard four-team cup format, which saw Dundee United beat Sheffield Wednesday 2–1 in the final. United beat rivals Dundee in the first semi-final, while Sheffield Wednesday saw off Wolverhampton Wanderers on penalties in the other. On 29 March 2006, it was announced the 2006 tournament would be slimmed down to a single derby match between Dundee and Dundee United. On 22 June 2006, sponsorship was announced for the competition, which would see it renamed the Evening Telegraph Challenge Cup; Radio Tay would also sponsor the event. The match was preceded by celebrity and fans matches. In 2007, the tournament was to be scheduled for an international weekend during the season, as Dundee United played Barcelona and did not wish to play a pre-season derby so close after that match.

{"text": "Smoking in Argentina accounts for 15% of total tobacco consumption in the Americas. In the 20th century, the government promoted settlement and economic development in the northern subtropical zones, with tobacco playing a central role. A new government agency worked to educate farmers and promote the cultivation, processing, and marketing of tobacco. While tobacco factories were initially concentrated around Buenos Aires, they gradually extended into the northern production regions. By 1960, Argentina accomplished self-sufficiency in tobacco production. By the 1970s, its annual output exceeded 60,000 metric tons, with one-third exported. At the local level cooperatives are active, they sell to one of two multinational companies, Nobleza-Picardo, an affiliate of the British American Tobacco company, and Messalin-Particulares, associated with Philip Morris International. Argentina held the global rank of third place in terms of production, trailing behind Brazil and Mexico. There are a number of smoking restrictions in place in different jurisdictions, and a nationwide governmental campaign against tobacco smoking and advertising. Since June 1, 2011 a smoking ban in all of Argentina prohibits smoking in workplaces, all public indoor areas, schools, hospitals, museums and libraries, theatres, and all public transport. In 2006, the prevalence of current tobacco use was 32% (35% among men, 29% among women). Approximately 90% of the population who smoked did so on a daily basis, and 30% smoked an average of 20 cigarettes per day. T Tobacco causes 40,000 deaths per year, 6,000 due to secondhand smoke. The cost of the treatment of tobacco-related diseases amounts to 6020 million Argentine pesos ($1324 million USD) per year, 15.5% of the total public expenditure on health care. The government collects 3500 million pesos per year in taxes on cigarettes. Law National Law 23344, passed on 29 August 1986, established restrictions on advertising and promotion of tobacco, and dictated that cigarette packs must include a legend warning that Smoking is harmful to health, but did not include sanctions against violations of the law; these were added later, and then partially vetoed. WHO Framework Convention In September 2003 Argentina signed the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, though ratification was delayed by two years. Analysts blame tobacco industry interests for this delay, as with previous failures in implementing serious anti-smoking policies. Legislative deadlock , a proposal to prohibit smoking in all public and enclosed spaces, sent by the Executive to the National Congress in August 2005, was awaiting consideration. Legislative lobbying from the tobacco industry proposed an alternative, weaker law, championed by Jujuy Province Senator Liliana Fellner, who called herself \"the voice of the [tobacco] producers\" (Jujuy is one of the seven tobacco-producing provinces in Argentina). Public sentiment A nationwide telephone survey published in August 2006 showed overwhelming support of the population for laws that establish \"smoke-free spaces\" in public spaces such as offices, factories, shopping malls and banks (93.4% overall support, 85% among smokers), and that completely forbid smoking in schools, universities and hospitals (97%). More than three quarters among the surveyed (including almost two thirds of the smokers) also supported smoking bans for bars and restaurants. Provincial and municipal laws on smoking In 2003, according to national sources, 75% of the Argentine provinces had some form of smoke-free legislation. Either in addition to or in the absence of provincial laws, many municipalities have local regulations to the same effect. Fines might be established for trespassers (tobacco companies, businesses and private individuals). The actual application of this legislation varies considerably. In Santa Fe it is forbidden to smoke in enclosed public spaces (offices, restaurants) and to sell tobacco to minors since 2005. (Provincial Law 12432) In La Rioja and Chubut it is forbidden to smoke in enclosed spaces and in public offices. In Mendoza there are also \"smoke-free spaces\" in schools, hospitals and other public buildings. In Córdoba (Provincial Law 9113, Córdoba Municipal Order 11039) and Tucumán (Provincial Law 7575), smoking bans for public places are in effect since mid-2006. In Buenos Aires City it is forbidden to smoke in government offices and (since October 2006) in all public enclosed spaces, except in businesses of more than 100 m² where smoking areas have been set up. (Law 1799) Chaco, Neuquén, Tierra del Fuego and Salta have similar laws.

{"text": "Los Cañoneros (The Cannoneers) is a Venezuelan cañonero group. It was created to emulate the times and songs of Caracas in 1920. They made their first public appearance in Mérida, in the Bullfighting Arena of Mérida November 20, 1982. They were an overwhelming success in Caracas, enlivening parties and private shows. Then came the professionalization by recording several albums, performing on radio and television. They are led by Hely and Ylich Orsini. They have toured in Spain, Germany, Portugal and the Caribbean countries. The \"cañonera music\" is a musical style born in the capital of Venezuela in the early 20th century. It is the first urban musical expression in this country. It has many similarities with the Dixieland developed in New Orleans. The groups that play \"cañonera\" music include several Venezuelan rhythms like the Venezuelan merengue, a variant of the pasodoble, joropo, and Venezuelan waltz. As of 2017 there are only two groups dedicated to preserving the traditional music of Caracas: Los Antaños del Stadium (1946) and Los Cañoneros. Their most recent record is Esta es Caracas (2012), a Venezuelan merengue featuring some of the most important singers in Venezuela: Cecilia Todd, Horacio Blanco (lead vocal for the ska band Desorden Publico), Ramsés Meneses a.k.a. McKlopedia, Aristides Barbella (), Max Pizzolante, Francisco Pacheco and Serenata Guayanesa.

{"text": "Apollonius of Ephesus (; fl. 180–210) was an anti-Montanist Greek ecclesiastical writer, probably from Asia Minor. He was thoroughly acquainted with the Christian history of Ephesus and the doings of the Phrygian Montanists. The unknown author of Praedestinatus says he was a Bishop of Ephesus. However, the lack of support from other Christian writers makes this testimony doubtful. He undertook the defense of the Church against Montanus, and followed in the footsteps of Zoticus of Comanus, Julian of Apamaea, Sotas of Anchialus, and Apollinaris of Hierapolis. His work is cited by Eusebius, and is praised by Jerome, but has been lost, and not even its title is known. It most likely argued the falsity of the Montanist prophecies and recounted the lives of Montanus and his prophets. It also gave currency to the report of their suicide by hanging, and threw light on some of the adepts of the sect, including the apostate Themison, and the pseudo-martyr Alexander. Themison, having evaded martyrdom by means of money, posed as an innovator, addressing a letter to his partisans after the manner of the Apostles, and finally insulted Jesus and Christianity. Alexander, a notorious thief, publicly condemned at Ephesus, had himself adored as a god. Based on Eusebius, it is known that Apollonius spoke in his work of Zoticus, who, along with Julian of Apamea, had tried to exorcise Maximilla, but had been prevented by Themison, and of the martyr-Bishop Thraseas, another adversary of Montanism. He likely gave the signal in it for the movement of opposition to Montanism which the reunion of the first synods developed. At all events, he recalls the tradition according to which Jesus had advised the Apostles not to go far from Jerusalem during the twelve years immediately following his Ascension, a tradition known to Clement of Alexandria from the apocryphal Praedicatio Petri. Moreover, he recounts the restoration to life of a dead man at Ephesus by John the Apostle, whose Apocalypse he knew and quotes. He takes rank among the opponents of Montanism with the \"Anonymous\" of Eusebius, with Miltiades and with Apollinaris. Eusebius says his work constituted \"an abundant and excellent refutation of Montanism\". St. Jerome qualified it as \"a lengthy and remarkable volume\". It did not therefore pass unnoticed, and roused some feeling among the Montanists since Tertullian felt it necessary to reply to it. After his six books peri ekstaseos, in which he apologized for the ecstasies into which the Montanist prophets fell before prophesying, Tertullian composed a seventh especially to refute Apollonius; he wrote it also in Greek for the use of the Asiatic Montanists.

{"text": "Tangier disease or hypoalphalipoproteinemia is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by a severe reduction in the amount of high density lipoprotein (HDL), often referred to as \"good cholesterol\", in the bloodstream. Worldwide, approximately 100 cases have even been identified. The disorder was originally discovered on Tangier Island off the coast of Virginia, but has now been identified in people from many different countries. Signs and symptoms Individuals that are homozygotes for Tangier's disease develop various cholesterol ester depositions. These are especially visible in the tonsils, as they may appear yellow/orange. The cholesterol esters may also be found in lymph nodes, bone marrow, the liver and spleen. Due to the cholesterol ester depositions the tonsils may be enlarged. Hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen) is common. Neuropathy and cardiovascular disease are the most devastating developments caused by Tangier's disease. Genetics Mutations to chromosome 9q31 lead to a defective ABCA1 transporter. These mutations prevent the ABCA1 protein from effectively transporting cholesterol and phospholipids out of cells for pickup by ApoA1 in the bloodstream. This inability to transport cholesterol out of cells leads to a deficiency of high-density lipoproteins in the circulation, which is a risk factor for coronary artery disease. Additionally, the buildup of cholesterol in cells can be toxic, causing cell death or impaired function. These combined factors lead to the signs and symptoms of Tangier disease. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that for the phenotype to appear, two copies of the gene must be present in the genotype. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder. Diagnosis Tangier disease results in familial high-density lipoprotein deficiency. High-density lipoproteins are created when a protein in the bloodstream, Apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), combines with cholesterol and phospholipids. The cholesterol and phospholipids used to form HDL originate from inside cells but are transported out of the cell into the blood via the ABCA1 transporter. People with Tangier disease have defective ABCA1 transporters resulting in a greatly reduced ability to transport cholesterol out of their cells, which leads to an accumulation of cholesterol and phospholipids in many body tissues, which can cause them to increase in size. Reduced blood levels of high-density lipoproteins is sometimes described as hypoalphalipoproteinemia. People affected by this condition also have slightly elevated amounts of fat in the blood (mild hypertriglyceridemia) and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). The tonsils are visibly affected by this disorder; they frequently appear orange or yellow and are extremely enlarged. Affected people often develop premature atherosclerosis, which is characterized by fatty deposits and scar-like tissue lining the arteries. Other signs of this condition may include an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), clouding of the cornea, and early-onset cardiovascular disease. Treatment There are drugs that can increase serum HDL such as niacin or gemfibrozil. While these drugs are useful for patients with hyperlipidemia, Tangier's disease patients do not benefit from these pharmaceutical interventions. Therefore, the only current treatment modality for Tangier's disease is diet modification. A low-fat diet can reduce some of the symptoms, especially those involving neuropathies. History In 1959, a five-year-old patient named Teddy Laird from Tangier Island, Virginia, presented with strikingly large and yellow-orange tonsils which were removed by armed forces physicians. After initial diagnosis with Niemann-Pick he was transferred to Dr. Louis Avioli at the National Cancer Institute. Donald Fredrickson, then head of the Molecular Disease Branch, became aware of the case and had a hunch that the original diagnosis was incorrect. In 1960, he traveled with Dr. Avioli to Tangier Island for further investigation. After finding the same symptom in Teddy's sister, an investigation revealed an extremely high number of foam cells (cholesterol ester-laden macrophages) in not only the tonsils, but also in a wide range of tissues, including the bone marrow and spleen. During a second trip to the island, they found that the family had very low levels of HDL cholesterol, suggesting a genetic basis of the disease.

{"text": "Nostell Miners Welfare Football Club is an English football club based in New Crofton, West Yorkshire. The club are currently members of the . History Prior to the current club, a team under the name of Nostell Colliery Football Club played in the village during the 1890s and early 1900s; the team won the Wakefield and District League during this period. The current club Nostell Miners Welfare Football Club was founded in 1928, after the purchasing of a plot of land to play on for £400, the location which they remain at today. The club won the Wakefield and District League during the 1937–1938 season. Play was halted for World War II, but when the club returned they were successful in several colliery football competitions. In the late 1950s, the club toured Belgium and won a trophy on their tour. In the late 1960s, Nostell Miners Welfare continued their success in the Wakefield area eventually been brought up to the West Yorkshire League. The 1966–67 season was a successful one for the club, as they won the West Yorkshire League and cup double. By the early 1970s, they were once again playing in the Wakefield and District League. After a period of rebuilding of their squad, the club managed to regain the success of previous years and were promoted to the West Yorkshire League in 1982. The club worked their way up to the West Yorkshire League Premier Division to begin a successful period in their history. Alan Colquhoun took over as manager in the late 1990s, helping the club gradually improve in the league, becoming champions in 2004–05. They also appeared in the cup finals three consecutive times. They finished well during the 2005–06 season, and, as champions Leeds Metropolitan Carnegie were not eligible for promotion, Nostell Miners Welfare along with A.F.C. Emley were promoted to the Northern Counties East Football League Division One and won promotion to the Premier Division the following season. This is the highest the club has ever been in their history. On 28 April 2009, Nostell won the Northern Counties East Football League Presidents Cup final against Scarborough Athletic, away at Bridlington, winning 3–2 on aggregate. In October 2016 Nostell appointed Chris Ellerby as Manager who was previously with Halifax Irish FC in the West Riding County Amateur League.

{"text": "\"Getting Away with It\" is the first single by the English band Electronic, which comprised Bernard Sumner of New Order, ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr, and guesting vocalist Neil Tennant of Pet Shop Boys. It was first released in 1989. Composition Musically, Bernard Sumner wrote the verse and Johnny Marr wrote the chorus. The lyrics, co-written by Tennant with Sumner, are a parody of Marr's Smiths partner Morrissey, and his public stereotyping as morose and masochistic (Pet Shop Boys would further satirise this trend on their 1990 song \"Miserablism\"). Morrissey, for his part, criticized the song in a 1991 interview, calling it \"totally useless\" and joking that the song had a \"very apt title\". In a 2021 interview with Music Radar, Marr revealed that Chris Lowe also worked on the track, citing the bassline as his work. ABC and The The Drummer David Palmer programmed the track's drums. The fluid, rich production incorporates a full orchestra (conducted by Art of Noise's Anne Dudley) and a rare guitar solo by Marr, while the three remixes that appeared on the two UK 12-inch releases take in disparate musical styles like disco and acid house. Single \"Getting Away with It\" was first issued by Factory Records in the United Kingdom in December 1989, and released the following year in the rest of the world. It appeared on 7-inch, 12-inch, CD and cassette. The primary B-side was an instrumental called \"Lucky Bag\", the only unadulterated reflection of Marr and Sumner's early, shared enthusiasm for Italo house. This song was also remixed and released on the UK maxi single. As well as the single edit and three 12-inch remixes, \"Getting Away with It\" was released as an instrumental; as an unedited, longer version; and in its early form before Dudley's strings were added (this is the only version of the song which has yet to be released on Compact Disc; the 7-inch edit was included on both the US and UK CD singles despite being labelled \"Full Length Version\"). The Full Length Version on the 12\" vinyl version is 5:14 - as used on the 1994 CD re-issue of the album. The 7\" mix is just the \"Full Length Version\" faded out before the strings outro. Artwork The single's cover was designed by Peter Saville, who used an elegant stock photo of a glass of whisky. The title was originally written in sentence case, just as Pet Shop Boys songs are. The photograph was inverted for the second UK 12-inch, with the typeface from the Panasonic logo appropriated for the band's name. This arrangement was used for the US editions of the single in 1990. Music videos Two music videos were made for \"Getting Away with It\". The first, directed by Chris Marker and produced by Michael Shamberg for European use in 1989, featured Sumner, Marr and Tennant in a studio environment miming to the single edit of the song. Additional footage of Marker's muse Catherine Belkhodja, strolling among peacocks through Paris Zoo and also singing to the track, was left out. The second video, shot in 1990, was made for the US release. Sumner and Tennant appeared, alternately, against a series of coloured background, with artistic effects superimposed. Two women's faces are also panned in close-up. The later version is available on the 2006 Get the Message DVD. Reception Ben Thompson in the NME wrote \"The most complete pop record of the week, by an infinite margin...A lovely airy melody drifts in and out of the song; gently weighted with obtuse, lovelorn one-liners...The record somehow manages to be much more than the sum of its parts and stubbornly refuses to give up its element of mystery\". In Sounds Damon Wise wrote: \"It's nothing shocking, nothing that surprising, it's just that every time you think you're tired of it you can't help flipping back the stylus to catch that chorus\". Today the song remains well-known due to its commercial success (it reached number 12 in the UK and number 38 in the USA), the calibre of its performers, and the fact that it was Electronic's debut single (and was thus anticipated by both the music press and fans of New Order, The Smiths and Pet Shop Boys at the time).

Pet Shop Boys guested on all these performances. \"Getting Away With It\" is a common part of Johnny Marr's live sets, and in July 2013 Sumner joined Marr at Jodrell Bank to perform the song. Appearances Although the music was written with their first album in mind — and before their involvement with Neil Tennant — \"Getting Away with It\" was not included on Electronic's first LP in May 1991 (a reflection of their confidence in the newer material), although it was slotted in between tracks 4 and 5 on the international versions and the subsequent 1994 reissue on Parlophone, to bolster sales. In some territories \"Getting Away with It\" replaced the album track \"Gangster\". \"Getting Away with It\" also appeared on the Australian \"Forbidden City\" CD single in 1996, and in two versions on a withdrawn compilation planned for release in Japan three years later. It has also featured on a variety of various artists compilations, sometimes in remixed form, and was the second track on the retrospective set Get the Message – The Best of Electronic in 2006. Additional information The song was recorded by British artist Skin for inclusion on the re-release of her debut album Fleshwounds. Unlike the original, the music was updated to a more rock-edged sound. It has since become a fan favourite at her gigs and is never left out of a setlist. A double A-side of the song was to be released with her single \"Lost\", but due to poor sales of the album and singles it was pulled by EMI at the last minute. No video was shot for the song. The phrase 'getting away with this' was used in a Spitting Image spoof of Pet Shop Boys in 1993.

Education and career Bakhuis Roozeboom (originally \"Bakhuys Roozeboom\") was born in Alkmaar in the Netherlands. Financial difficulties did not allow him to directly pursue a university education, and he left school to work in a chemical factory for some time. Due to support from his mentor, J. M. van Bemmelen, he became an assistant at the University of Leiden in 1878, which enabled him to start his academic education there. In 1881 he became a teacher at a girls school, and in 1884 he obtained his PhD with works on the hydrates of acids. J. D. van der Waals introduced him to the theoretical works of J. Willard Gibbs on the phase rule which so far had little experimental verification in chemistry, prompting him to start a lifelong research program on phase equilibria. In 1896, he became professor for chemistry at the University of Amsterdam, where he died on February 8, 1907. Bakhuis Roozeboom's main work was in the field of thermodynamics, in which he studied the equilibrium of multiple-phase systems. The theoretical foundations for this were laid by J. Willard Gibbs with his phase rule, but Roozeboom would be the one to apply the theory and demonstrate its usefulness. He is mainly remembered for his melting phase diagrams of metal alloys, i.e. studying how mixtures of metals melt depending on the relative amounts of the components, which is important for metallurgy. Roozeboom also was the first to plot ternary phase equilibria in two-dimensional plots that were taken as vertical or horizontal slices from the three-dimensional solid diagrams. These are termed, respectively, isopleths and isotherms. He also contributed to the science of chiral substances, clarified how to distinguish the different types of crystalline racemates and predicted how mixtures of enantiomers behave in a heterogeneous system of solid and solution. In 1890 Bakhuis Roozeboom became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Roozeboom succeeded J. H. van't Hoff at the University of Amsterdam. In 1904, he published the first volume and first part of the second volume of the multi-volume treatise on heterogeneous equilibria entitled Die Heterogenen Gleichgewichte von Standpunkte des Phasenlehre \"Heterogeneous Equilibria from the Phase Rule Viewpoint.\" In 1911, the Bakhuis Roozeboom Fund was established in his honour; every four years it awards a gold medal for research on phase theory.

{"text": "Jacopo Berengario da Carpi (also known as Jacobus Berengarius Carpensis, Jacopo Barigazzi, Giacomo Berengario da Carpi or simply Carpus; c. 1460 – c. 1530) was an Italian physician. His book \"Isagoge breves\" published in 1522 made him the most important anatomist before Andreas Vesalius. Early years Jacopo Berengario da Carpi was the son of a surgeon. As a youth he assisted his father in surgical work, and his surgical skills became the basis of his later work as a physician. In his late teens, through the association of his family with Lionello Pio, Berengario came under the tutelage of the great humanist printer, Aldo Manuzio who came to Carpi to tutor Alberto III Pio, Prince of Carpi and apparently included Berengario in his instruction. In the 1480s, Berengario attended university in Bologna receiving his degree in medicine in 1489. Fame through mercury cure for syphilis After obtaining his degree, Berengario returned to his father and assisted him with his surgery practice for a short time, but the influx of the \"French disease\" in 1494 provided Berengario with a chance to advance his career as a physician. Traveling to Rome, he treated several patients who suffered from the ailment. Judging by an admittedly one-sided account, his work in Rome was a mix of financial success and medical failure. As quoted in Lind's introduction to the Isagoge, Benvenuto Cellini provided a scathing account of Berengario's practice of treating syphilis with doses of mercury while charging \"hundreds of crowns\" paid in advance. Berengario apparently developed enough of a reputation that the Pope invited him into his service, but he turned down the offer and left Rome shortly thereafter. Anatomy in Bologna Shortly after his work in Rome, he was appointed Maestro nello Studio at Bologna, a university whose faculty were only rarely foreign and then only when they were scholars of considerable reputations. Berengario’s reputation and personal connections with powerful patrons were indeed quite strong. In 1504, the Pope granted him Bolognese citizenship, and he was asked to treat distinguished patients on several occasions including Alessandro Soderini (relative of a Cardinal and part of the Medici family) in 1513 and Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino in 1517. Along with his reputation, Berengario increased his wealth becoming a collector of a variety of artworks including a Roman statue, a painting attributed to Raphael and a pair of vases by Cellini and eventually a house large enough to hold them all. By all accounts, Berengario was both a popular teacher and an accomplished cultivator of powerful friends. Official university records indicate his success as a teacher over one of his colleagues. He was adept enough at diplomacy to be made court surgeon to the Duke of Ferrara in 1529 after leaving Bologna despite having been condemned to pay a fine or have his nose cut off in 1500 for speaking insultingly of that ducal court. Berengario’s personality is commonly characterized by citing his tendency to violent confrontation. In 1511, he attacked and robbed a stipendiary of the Pope. Also in 1511, he attacked a doctor who sought refuge in a nearby house. The wife of the owner of the house was injured in the process. In 1520, for reasons not quite clear, Berengario along with an entourage attacked the home of Zambelli Petenghi with the intention of taking possession of it and killing its owner. Unable to gain entry, he was forced to content himself with doing damage to the house instead. Apparently due to his personal connections, he remained unpunished for any of his misdeeds. Legacy Berengario’s publishing record began in 1514 with an edition of Mondino. In 1518 he published his De fractura cranei and in 1521 his Commentary on Mondino. The Commentary was then supplemented by the Isagogae Breves in 1522 which was a greatly condensed version of the same work “for the common use of all good men”. Berengario made several important advances in anatomy including the first anatomical text augmented by illustrations, \"Anatomia Carpi. Isagoge breves perlucide ac uberime, in Anatomiam humani corporis\". This book emphasized the sensory over textual versions of the truth, an emphasis on dissection of human cadavers, some first denials of Galenic anatomy based on personal experience in dissection, and a preference for dissection of numerous bodies following a specific program of investigation. Whereas other anatomists claimed few actual dissections to their name, in 1522 Berengario da Carpi claimed to have anatomized several hundred bodies. He also denied the existence of Galen's rete mirabile. Later Vesalius claimed he was the first to do so.

{"text": "Latin American culture is the formal or informal expression of the people of Latin America and includes both high culture (literature and high art) and popular culture (music, folk art, and dance), as well as religion and other customary practices. These are generally of Western origin, but have various degrees of Native American, African and Asian influence. Definitions of Latin America vary. From a cultural perspective, Latin America generally refers to those parts of the Americas whose cultural, religious and linguistic heritage can be traced to the Latin culture of the late Roman Empire. This would include areas where Spanish, Portuguese, French and various other Romance languages, which can trace their origin to the Vulgar Latin spoken in the late Roman Empire, are natively spoken. Such territories include almost all of Mexico, Central America and South America, with the exception of English or Dutch speaking territories. Culturally, it could also encompass the French derived culture in North America, as it ultimately derives from Latin Roman influence as well. There is also an important Latin American cultural presence in the United States since the 16th century in areas such as California, Texas and Florida, which were part of the Spanish Empire. More recently, in cities such as New York, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Miami. The richness of Latin American culture is the product of many influences, including: Spanish and Portuguese culture, owing to the region's history of colonization, settlement and continued immigration from Spain and Portugal. All the core elements of Latin American culture are of Iberian origin, which is ultimately related to Western Culture. Pre-Columbian cultures, whose importance is today particularly notable in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay. These cultures are central to Indigenous communities such as the Quechua, Maya, and Aymara. 19th- and 20th-century European immigration from Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany, France, and Eastern Europe; which transformed the region and had an impact in countries such as Argentina, Peru, Uruguay, Brazil (particular the southeast and southern regions), Colombia, Cuba, Chile, Venezuela, Ecuador (particularly in the southwest coast), Paraguay, Dominican Republic (specifically the northern region), and Mexico (particularly the northern region). Chinese, Indian, Lebanese and other Arab, Armenian, Korean, Japanese and various other Asian groups. Mostly immigrants and indentured laborers who arrived from the coolie trade and influenced the culture of Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Panama, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Peru in areas such as food, art, and cultural trade. The culture of Africa brought by Africans in the Trans-Atlantic former slave trade has influenced various parts of Latin America. Influences are particularly strong in dance, music, cuisine, and some syncretic religions of Cuba, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Northwest Ecuador, coastal Colombia, and Nicaragua. Ethnic groups The population of Latin America is very diverse with many ethnic groups and different ancestries. Most of the Amerindian descendants are of mixed race ancestry. In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries there was a flow of Spanish and Portuguese emigrants who left for Latin America. It was never a large movement of people, but over the long period of time it had a major impact on Latin American populations: the Portuguese left for Brazil and the Spaniards left for Central and South America. Of the European immigrants, men greatly outnumbered women and many married Natives. This resulted in a mixing of the Amerindians and Europeans and today their descendants are known as mestizos. Even Latin American criollos, of mainly European ancestry, usually have some Native ancestry. Today, mestizos make up the majority of Latin America's population. Starting in the late 16th century, a large number of former African slaves were brought to Latin America, especially to Brazil and the Caribbean. Nowadays, blacks make up the majority of the population in most Caribbean countries. Many of the former African slaves in Latin America mixed with the Europeans and their descendants (known as mulattoes) make up the majority of the population in some countries, such as the Dominican Republic, and large percentages in Brazil, Colombia, Nicaragua, etc. Mixes between the blacks and Amerindians also occurred, and their descendants are known as zambos. Many Latin American countries also have a substantial tri-racial population known as pardos, whose ancestry is a mix of Amerindians, Europeans and Africans. Large numbers of European immigrants arrived in Latin America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most of them settling in the Southern Cone (Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil). Nowadays the Southern Cone has a majority of people of largely European descent and in all more than 80% of Latin America's European population, which is mostly descended from six groups of immigrants: Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, French, Germans, Jews (both Ashkenazi and Sephardic) and, to a lesser extent, Irish, Poles, Greeks, Croats, Russians, Welsh, Ukrainians, etc. In this same period, immigrants came from the Middle East and Asia, including Indians, Lebanese, Syrians, Armenians, and, more recently, Koreans, Chinese and Japanese, mainly to Brazil. These people only make up a small percentage of Latin America's population but they have communities in the major cities. This diversity has profoundly influenced religion, music and politics. This cultural heritage is called Latino in American English. Language Spanish is spoken in Puerto Rico and eighteen sovereign nations (See Spanish language in the Americas). Portuguese is spoken primarily in Brazil (See Brazilian Portuguese). French is also spoken, in Haiti and French dependencies in the Caribbean. Several nations, especially in the Caribbean, have their own Creole languages, derived from European languages and various African tongues. Amerindian languages are spoken in many Latin American nations, mainly Chile, Panama, Ecuador, Colombia, Guatemala, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina, and Mexico. Nahuatl has more than a million speakers in Mexico. Although Mexico has almost 80 native languages across the country, the government nor the constitution specify an official language (not even Spanish), also, some regions of the nation do not speak any modern way of language and still preserve their ancient dialect without knowing any other language. Guaraní is, along with Spanish, the official language of Paraguay, and is spoken by a majority of the population. Furthermore, there are about 10 million Quechua speakers in South America and Spain, but more than half of them live in Bolivia and Peru (approximately 6,700,800 individuals). Other European languages spoken include Italian in Brazil and Uruguay, German in southern Brazil and southern Chile, and Welsh in southern Argentina. Religion The primary religion throughout Latin America is Christianity (90%), mostly Roman Catholicism. Latin America, and in particular Brazil, were active in developing the quasi-socialist Roman Catholic movement known as Liberation Theology. Practitioners of the Protestant, Pentecostal, Evangelical, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormon, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Baháʼí, and indigenous denominations and religions exist. Various Afro-Latin American traditions, such as Santería, and Macumba, a tribal- voodoo religion, are also practiced. Evangelicalism in particular is increasing in popularity. Latin America constitute in absolute terms the second world's largest Christian population, after Europe. Folklore Arts and leisure In long-term perspective, Britain's influence in Latin America was enormous after independence came in the 1820s. Britain deliberately sought to replace the Spanish and Portuguese in economic and cultural affairs. Military issues and colonization were minor factors. The influence was exerted through diplomacy, trade, banking, and investment in railways and mines. The English language and British cultural norms were transmitted by energetic young British business agents on temporary assignment in the major commercial centers, where they invited locals into the British leisure activities, such as organized sports, and into their transplanted cultural institutions such as schools and clubs. The British role never disappeared, but it faded rapidly after 1914 as the British cashed in their investments to pay for the Great War, and the United States, another Anglophone power, moved into the region with overwhelming force and similar cultural norms. Sports The British impact on sports was overwhelming, as Latin America took up football (called fútbol in Spanish and futebol in Portuguese). In Argentina, rugby, polo, tennis and golf became important middle-class leisure pastimes. In some parts of the Caribbean and Central America baseball outshined soccer in terms of popularity. The sport started in the late 19th century when sugar companies imported cane cutters from the British Caribbean. During their free time, the workers would play cricket, but later, during the long period of US military occupation, cricket gave way to baseball, which rapidly assumed widespread popularity, although cricket remains the favorite in the British Caribbean. Baseball had the greatest following in those nations occupied at length by the US military, especially the Dominican Republic and Cuba, as well as Nicaragua, Panama, and Puerto Rico. Even Venezuela, which wasn't occupied by the US military during this time period, still became a popular baseball destination. All of these countries have emerged as sources of baseball talent, since many players hone their skills on local teams, or in “academies” managed by the US Major Leagues to cultivate the most promising young men for their own teams. Literature Pre-Columbian cultures were primarily oral, though the Aztecs and Mayans, for instance, produced elaborate codices. Oral accounts of mythological and religious beliefs were also sometimes recorded after the arrival of European colonizers, as was the case with the Popol Vuh. Moreover, a tradition of oral narrative survives to this day, for instance among the Quechua-speaking population of Peru and the Quiché of Guatemala. From the very moment of Europe's \"discovery\" of the continent, early explorers and conquistadores produced written accounts and crónicas of their experience—such as Columbus's letters or Bernal Díaz del Castillo's description of the conquest of New Spain. During the colonial period, written culture was often in the hands of the church, within which context Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz wrote memorable poetry and philosophical essays. Towards the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, a distinctive criollo literary tradition emerged, including the first novels such as Lizardi's El Periquillo Sarniento (1816). The 19th century was a period of \"foundational fictions\" (in critic Doris Sommer's words), novels in the Romantic or Naturalist traditions that attempted to establish a sense of national identity, and which often focussed on the indigenous question or the dichotomy of \"civilization or barbarism\" (for which see, say, Domingo Sarmiento's Facundo (1845), Juan León Mera's Cumandá (1879), or Euclides da Cunha's Os Sertões (1902)). At the turn of the 20th century, modernismo emerged, a poetic movement whose founding text was Rubén Darío's Azul (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no longer so much at issue. José Martí, for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere. However, what really put Latin American literature on the global map was no doubt the literary boom of the 1960s and 1970s, distinguished by daring and experimental novels (such as Julio Cortázar's Rayuela (1963)) that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English. The Boom's defining novel was Gabriel García Márquez's Cien años de soledad (1967), which led to the association of Latin American literature with magic realism, though other important writers of the period such as Mario Vargas Llosa and Carlos Fuentes do not fit so easily within this framework. Arguably, the Boom's culmination was Augusto Roa Bastos's monumental Yo, el supremo (1974). In the wake of the Boom, influential precursors such as Juan Rulfo, Alejo Carpentier, and above all Jorge Luis Borges were also rediscovered. Contemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling Paulo Coelho and Isabel Allende to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as Giannina Braschi, Diamela Eltit, Ricardo Piglia, Roberto Bolaño or Daniel Sada. There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of testimony, texts produced in collaboration with subaltern subjects such as Rigoberta Menchú. Finally, a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic Carlos Monsiváis and Pedro Lemebel. The region boasts six Nobel Prizewinners: in addition to the Colombian García Márquez (1982), also the Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral (1945), the Guatemalan novelist Miguel Ángel Asturias (1967), the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda (1971), the Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz (1990), and the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa (2010). Philosophy The history of Latin American philosophy is usefully divided into five periods: Pre-Columbian, Colonial, Independentist, Nationalist, and Contemporary (that is, the twentieth century to the present). Among the major Latin American philosophers is Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (Mexico, 1651–1695), a philosopher, composer, poet of the Baroque period, and Hieronymite nun of New Spain (Mexico). Sor Juana was the first philosopher to question the status of the woman in Latin American society. When Catholic Church official instructed Sor Juana to abandon intellectual pursuits that were improper for a woman, Sor Juana's extensive answer defends rational equality between men and women, makes a powerful case for women's right to education, and develops an understanding of wisdom as a form of self-realization. Among the most prominent political philosophers in Latin America was José Martí's (Cuba 1854–1895), who pioneered Cuban liberal thought that lead to the Cuban War of Independence. Elsewhere in Latin America, during the 1870-1930 period, the philosophy of positivism or \"cientificismo\" associated with Auguste Comte in France and Herbert Spencer in England exerted an influence on intellectuals, experts and writers in the region. Francisco Romero (Argentina 1891–1962) coined the phrase 'philosophical normality' in 1940, in reference to philosophical thinking as 'an ordinary function of culture in Hispanic America.' Other Latin American philosophers of his era include Alejandro Korn (Argentina, 1860–1936) who authored 'The Creative Freedom' and José Vasconcelos (Mexico, 1882–1959) whose work spans metaphysics, aesthetics, and the philosophy of 'the Mexican'. Poet and essayist Octavio Paz (1914-1998) was a Mexican diplomat, and poet, and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1990. Paz who is one of the most influential writers on Latin American and Spanish culture from Sor Juana to Remedios Varos. More recent Latin American philosophers who practice Latina/o or Latino philosophy include: Walter Mignolo (1941-), Maria Lugones (1948-), and Susana Nuccetelli (1954) from Argentina; Jorge J. E. Gracia (1942), Gustavo Pérez Firmat (1949) and Ofelia Schutte (1944) from Cuba; Linda Martín Alcoff (1955) from Panama; Giannina Braschi (1953) from Puerto Rico; and Eduardo Mendieta (1963) from Colombia. Their formats and styles of Latino philosophical writing differ greatly as the subject matters. Walter Mignolo's book \"The Idea of Latin America\" expounds on how the idea of Latin America and Latin American philosopher, as a precursor to Latino philosophy, was formed and propagated. Giannina Braschi's writings on Puerto Rican independence focus on financial terrorism, debt, and “feardom”. Latina/o philosophy is a tradition of thought referring both to the work of many Latina/o philosophers in the United States and to a specific set of philosophical problems and method of questioning that relate to Latina/o identity as a hyphenated experience, borders, immigration, gender, race and ethnicity, feminism, and decoloniality. “Latina/o philosophy” is used by some to refer also to Latin American philosophy practiced within Latin America and the United States, while others argue that to maintain specificity Latina/o philosophy should only refer to a subset of Latin American philosophy. Music Latin American music comes in many varieties, from the simple, rural conjunto music of northern Mexico to the sophisticated habanera of Cuba, from the symphonies of Heitor Villa-Lobos to the simple and moving Andean flute. Music has played an important part in Latin America's turbulent recent history, for example the nueva canción movement. Latin music is very diverse, with the only truly unifying thread being the use of the Spanish language or, in Brazil, the similar Portuguese language. Latin America can be divided into several musical areas. Andean music, for example, includes the countries of western South America, typically Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile and Venezuela; Central American music includes Nicaragua, El Salvador, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica. Caribbean music includes the Caribbean coast of Colombia, Panama, and many Spanish and French-speaking islands in the Caribbean, including French Guiana, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the less noted Martinique and Guadeloupe. The inclusion of the French West Indies varies by scholars. Brazil perhaps constitutes its own musical area, both because of its large size and incredible diversity as well as its unique history as a Portuguese colony. Musically, Latin America has also influenced its former colonial metropoles. Spanish music (and Portuguese music) and Latin American music strongly cross-fertilized each other, but Latin music also absorbed influences from the English-speaking world, as well as African music. One of the main characteristics of Latin American music is its diversity, from the lively rhythms of Central America and the Caribbean to the more austere sounds of southern South America. Another feature of Latin American music is its original blending of the variety of styles that arrived in The Americas and became influential, from the early Spanish and European Baroque to the different beats of the African rhythms. Latino-Caribbean music, such as salsa, merengue, bachata, etc., are styles of music that have been strongly influenced by African rhythms and melodies. Other musical genres of Latin America include the Argentine and Uruguayan tango, the Colombian cumbia and vallenato, Mexican ranchera, the Cuban salsa, bolero, rumba and mambo, Nicaraguan palo de mayo, Uruguayan candombe, the Panamanian cumbia, tamborito, saloma and pasillo, and the various styles of music from Pre-Columbian traditions that are widespread in the Andean region. In Brazil, samba, American jazz, European classical music and choro combined into bossa nova. Recently the Haitian kompa has become increasingly popular. The classical composer Heitor Villa-Lobos (1887–1959) worked on the recording of native musical traditions within his homeland of Brazil. The traditions of his homeland heavily influenced his classical works. Also notable is the much recent work of the Cuban Leo Brouwer and guitar work of the Venezuelan Antonio Lauro and the Paraguayan Agustín Barrios. Arguably, the main contribution to music entered through folklore, where the true soul of the Latin American and Caribbean countries is expressed. Musicians such as Atahualpa Yupanqui, Violeta Parra, Víctor Jara, Mercedes Sosa, Jorge Negrete, Caetano Veloso, Yma Sumac and others gave magnificent examples of the heights that this soul can reach, for example:the Uruguayan born and first Latin American musician to win an OSCAR prize, Jorge Drexler. Latin pop, including many forms of rock, is popular in Latin America today (see Spanish language rock and roll). Film Latin American film is both rich and diverse. But the main centers of production have been Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba. Latin American cinema flourished after the introduction of sound, which added a linguistic barrier to the export of Hollywood film south of the border. The 1950s and 1960s saw a movement towards Third Cinema, led by the Argentine filmmakers Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino. More recently, a new style of directing and stories filmed has been tagged as \"New Latin American Cinema.\" Mexican movies from the Golden Era in the 1940s are significant examples of Latin American cinema, with a huge industry comparable to the Hollywood of those years. More recently movies such as Amores Perros (2000) and Y tu mamá también (2001) have been successful in creating universal stories about contemporary subjects, and were internationally recognised. Nonetheless, the country has also witnessed the rise of experimental filmmakers such as Carlos Reygadas and Fernando Eimbicke who focus on more universal themes and characters. Other important Mexican directors are Arturo Ripstein and Guillermo del Toro. Argentine cinema was a big industry in the first half of the 20th century. After a series of military governments that shackled culture in general, the industry re-emerged after the 1976–1983 military dictatorship to produce the Academy Award winner The Official Story in 1985. The Argentine economic crisis affected the production of films in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but many Argentine movies produced during those years were internationally acclaimed, including Plata Quemada (2000), Nueve reinas (2000), El abrazo partido (2004) and Roma (2004). In Brazil, the Cinema Novo movement created a particular way of making movies with critical and intellectual screenplays, a clearer photography related to the light of the outdoors in a tropical landscape, and a political message. The modern Brazilian film industry has become more profitable inside the country, and some of its productions have received prizes and recognition in Europe and the United States. Movies like Central do Brasil (1999) and Cidade de Deus (2003) have fans around the world, and its directors have taken part in American and European film projects. Cuban cinema has enjoyed much official support since the Cuban revolution, and important filmmakers include Tomás Gutiérrez Alea. Modern dance Latin America has a strong tradition of evolving dance styles. Some of its dance and music is considered to emphasize sexuality, and have become popular outside of their countries of origin. Salsa and the more popular Latin dances were created and embraced into the culture in the early and middle 1900s and have since been able to retain their significance both in and outside the Americas. The mariachi bands of Mexico stirred up quick paced rhythms and playful movements at the same time that Cuba embraced similar musical and dance styles. Traditional dances were blended with new, modern ways of moving, evolving into a blended, more contemporary forms. Ballroom studios teach lessons on many Latin American dances. One can even find the cha-cha being done in honky-tonk country bars. Miami has been a large contributor of the United States' involvement in Latin dancing. With such a huge Puerto Rican and Cuban population one can find Latin dancing and music in the streets at any time of day or night. Some of the dances of Latin America are derived from and named for the type of music they are danced to. For example, mambo, salsa, cha-cha-cha, rumba, merengue, samba, flamenco, bachata, and, probably most recognizable, the tango are among the most popular. Each of the types of music has specific steps that go with the music, the counts, the rhythms, and the style. Modern Latin American dancing is very energetic. These dances primarily are performed with a partner as a social dance, but solo variations exist. The dances emphasize passionate hip movements and the connection between partners. Many of the dances are done in a close embrace while others are more traditional and similar to ballroom dancing, holding a stronger frame between the partners. Theatre Theatre in Latin America existed before the Europeans came to the continent. The natives of Latin America had their own rituals, festivals, and ceremonies. They involved dance, singing of poetry, song, theatrical skits, mime, acrobatics, and magic shows. The performers were trained; they wore costumes, masks, makeup, wigs. Platforms had been erected to enhance visibility. The 'sets' were decorated with branches from trees and other natural objects. The Europeans used this to their advantage. For the first fifty years after the Conquest the missionaries used theatre widely to spread the Christian doctrine to a population accustomed to the visual and oral quality of spectacle and thus maintaining a form of cultural hegemony. It was more effective to use the indigenous forms of communication than to put an end to the 'pagan' practices, the conquerors took out the content of the spectacles, retained the trappings, and used them to convey their own message. Pre-Columbian rituals were how the indigenous came in contact with the divine. Spaniards used plays to Christianize and colonize the indigenous peoples of the Americas in the 16th century. Theatre was a potent tool in manipulating a population already accustomed to spectacle. Theatre became a tool for political hold on Latin America by colonialist theatre by using indigenous performance practices to manipulate the population. Theatre provided a way for the indigenous people were forced to participate in the drama of their own defeat. In 1599, the Jesuits even used cadavers of Native Americans to portray the dead in the staging of the final judgment. While the plays were promoting a new sacred order, their first priority was to support the new secular, political order. Theatre under the colonizers primarily at the service of the administration. After the large decrease in the native population, the indigenous consciousness and identity in theatre disappeared, though pieces did have indigenous elements to them. The theatre that progressed in Latin America is argued to be theatre that the conquerors brought to the Americas, not the theatre of the Americas. Progression in Postcolonial Latin American Theatre Internal strife and external interference have been the drive behind Latin American history which applies the same to theatre. 1959–1968: dramaturgical structures and structures of social projects leaned more toward constructing a more native Latin American base called the \"Nuestra America\" 1968–1974: Theatre tries to claim a more homogenous definition which brings in more European models. At this point, Latin American Theatre tried to connect to its historical roots. 1974–1984: The search for expression rooted in the history of Latin America became victims of exile and death. Latin American cuisine Latin American cuisine refers to the typical foods, beverages, and cooking styles common to many of the countries and cultures in Latin America. Latin America is a very diverse region with cuisines that vary from nation to nation. Some items typical of Latin American cuisine include maize-based dishes and drinks (tortillas, tamales, arepas, pupusas, chicha morada, chicha de jora) and various salsas and other condiments (guacamole, pico de gallo, mole). These spices are generally what give the Latin American cuisines a distinct flavor; yet, each country of Latin America tends to use a different spice and those that share spices tend to use them at different quantities. Thus, this leads to a variety across the land. Meat is also widely consumed, and constitutes one of the main ingredients in many Latin American countries where they are considered specialties, referred to as Asado or Churrasco. Latin American beverages are just as distinct as their foods. Some of the beverages can even date back to the times of the Native Americans. Some popular beverages include mate, Pisco Sour, horchata, chicha, atole, cacao and aguas frescas. Desserts in Latin America include dulce de leche, alfajor, arroz con leche, tres leches cake, Teja and flan. Regional cultures North America Mexico Historically, Mexicans have struggled with the creation of a united identity. This particular issue is the main topic of Mexican Nobel Prize winner Octavio Paz's book The Labyrinth of Solitude. Mexico is a large country with a large population, therefore having many cultural traits found only in some parts of the country. Northern Mexico is the least culturally diverse region due to its very low Native American population and high density of those of European descent. Northern Mexicans are also more Americanized due to the common border with the United States. Central and southern Mexico is where many well-known traditions find their origin, therefore the people from this area are in a way the most traditional, but their collective personality cannot be generalized. People from Puebla, for instance, are thought to be conservative and reserved, and just in the neighboring state of Veracruz, people have the fame of being outgoing and liberal. Chilangos (Mexico City natives) are believed to be a bit aggressive and self-centered. The regiomontanos (citizens from Monterrey) are thought to be rather proud and miserly, regardless of their social status. Almost every Mexican state has its own accent, making it fairly easy to distinguish the origin of someone by their use of language. The literature of Mexico has its antecedents in the literature of the indigenous settlements of Mesoamerica and European literature. The most well-known prehispanic poet is Netzahualcoyotl. Outstanding colonial writers and poets include Juan Ruiz de Alarcón and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz. The first novel to be written and published in Latin America is generally considered to be José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi's The Mangy Parrot (serialized from 1816 to 1831). Other notable Mexican writers include poets such as Octavio Paz (Nobel Laureate), Xavier Villaurrutia, and Ramón López Velarde, as well as prose writers such as Alfonso Reyes, Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, Nellie Campobello, Juan José Arreola, Carlos Fuentes, Agustín Yáñez, Elena Garro, Mariano Azuela, Juan Rulfo, Amparo Dávila, Jorge Ibargüengoitia, Guadalupe Dueñas, Bruno Traven and Fernando del Paso, and playwrights such as Maruxa Vilalta and Rodolfo Usigli. Contemporary Mexican authors include Álvaro Enrigue, Daniel Sada, Guadalupe Nettel, Juan Villoro, Jorge Volpi and Fernanda Melchor. The music of Mexico is very diverse and features a wide range of musical genres and performance styles. It has been influenced by a variety of cultures, most notably the culture of the indigenous people of Mexico and Europe. Music was an expression of Mexican nationalism, beginning in the nineteenth century. Prior to the foundation of Mexico as a nation-state, the original inhabitants of the land used drums (such as the teponaztli), flutes, rattles, conches as trumpets and their voices to make music and dances. This ancient music is still played in some parts of Mexico. However, much of the traditional contemporary music of Mexico was written during and after the Spanish colonial period, using many old world influenced instruments. Many traditional instruments, such as the Mexican vihuela used in Mariachi music, were adapted from their old world predecessors and are traditionally considered Mexican. Popular music genres include son huasteco, ranchera, Mexican bolero, mariachi, corrido, banda, and música norteña. Notable musicians and songwriters include José Mariano Elízaga, Juventino Rosas, Agustín Lara and José Alfredo Jiménez. Mexicans in places like Guadalajara, Puebla, Monterrey, Mexico City, and most middle-sized cities, enjoy a great variety of options for leisure. Shopping centers are a favorite among families, since there has been an increasing number of new malls that cater to people of all ages and interests. A large number of them, have multiplex cinemas, international and local restaurants, food courts, cafes, bars, bookstores and most of the international renowned clothing brands are found too. Mexicans are prone to travel within their own country, making short weekend trips to a neighbouring city or town. The standard of living in Mexico is higher than most of the other countries in Latin America attracting migrants in search for better opportunities. With the recent economic growth, many high-income families live in single houses, commonly found within a gated community, called \"fraccionamiento\". The reason these places are the most popular among the middle and upper classes is that they offer a sense of security and provide social status. Swimming pools or golf clubs, and/or some other commodities are found in these fraccionamientos. Poorer Mexicans, by contrast, live a harsh life, although they share the importance they grant to family, friends and cultural habits. Two of the major television networks based in Mexico are Televisa and TV Azteca. Soap operas (telenovelas) are translated to many languages and seen all over the world with renown names like Verónica Castro, Lucía Méndez, Lucero, and Thalía. Even Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna from Y tu mamá también and current Zegna model act in some of them. Some of their TV shows are modeled after American counterparts like Family Feud (100 Mexicanos Dijeron or \"A hundred Mexicans said\" in Spanish), Big Brother, American Idol, Saturday Night Live and others. Nationwide news shows like Las Noticias por Adela on Televisa resemble a hybrid between Donahue and Nightline. Local news shows are modeled after American counterparts like the Eyewitness News and Action News formats. Mexico's national sports are charreria and bullfighting. Pre-Columbian cultures played a ball game which still exists in Northwest Mexico (Sinaloa, the game is called Ulama), though it is not a popular sport anymore. A considerable portion of the Mexican population enjoys watching bullfights. Almost all large cities have bullrings. Mexico City has the largest bullring in the world, which seats 55,000 people. But the favorite sport remains football (soccer) while baseball is popular buts more specifically in the northern states (possibly because of the American influence), and a number of Mexicans have become stars in the US Major Leagues. Professional wrestling is shown on shows like Lucha Libre. American football is practiced at the major universities like UNAM. Basketball has also been gaining popularity, with a number of Mexican players having been drafted to play in the National Basketball Association. Central America Guatemala The culture of Guatemala reflects strong Mayan and Spanish influences and continues to be defined as a contrast between poor Mayan villagers in the rural highlands, and the urbanized and wealthy mestizos population who occupy the cities and surrounding agricultural plains. The cuisine of Guatemala reflects the multicultural nature of Guatemala, in that it involves food that differs in taste depending on the region. Guatemala has 22 departments (or divisions), each of which has very different food varieties. For example, Antigua Guatemala is well known for its candy which makes use of many local ingredients fruits, seeds and nuts along with honey, condensed milk and other traditional sweeteners. Antigua's candy is very popular when tourists visit the country for the first time and is a great choice in the search for new and interesting flavors. Many traditional foods are based on Maya cuisine and prominently feature corn, chiles and beans as key ingredients. Various dishes may have the same name as a dish from a neighboring country, but may in fact be quite different for example the enchilada or quesadilla, which are nothing like their Mexican counterparts. The music of Guatemala is diverse. Guatemala's national instrument is the marimba, an idiophone from the family of the xylophones, which is played all over the country, even in the remotest corners. Towns also have wind and percussion bands -week processions, as well as on other occasions. The Garifuna people of Afro-Caribbean descent, who are spread thinly on the northeastern Caribbean coast, have their own distinct varieties of popular and folk music. Cumbia, from the Colombian variety, is also very popular especially among the lower classes. Dozens of Rock bands have emerged in the last two decades, making rock music quite popular among young people. Guatemala also has an almost five-century-old tradition of art music, spanning from the first liturgical chant and polyphony introduced in 1524 to contemporary art music. Much of the music composed in Guatemala from the 16th century to the 19th century has only recently been unearthed by scholars and is being revived by performers. Guatemalan literature is famous around the world whether in the indigenous languages present in the country or in Spanish. Though there was likely literature in Guatemala before the arrival of the Spanish, all the texts that exist today were written after their arrival. The Popol Vuh is the most significant work of Guatemalan literature in the Quiché language, and one of the most important of Pre-Columbian American literature. It is a compendium of Mayan stories and legends, aimed to preserve Mayan traditions. The first known version of this text dates from the 16th century and is written in Quiché transcribed in Latin characters. It was translated into Spanish by the Dominican priest Francisco Ximénez in the beginning of the 18th century. Due to its combination of historical, mythical, and religious elements, it has been called the Mayan Bible. It is a vital document for understanding the culture of pre-Columbian America. The Rabinal Achí is a dramatic work consisting of dance and text that is preserved as it was originally represented. It is thought to date from the 15th century and narrates the mythical and dynastic origins of the Kek'chi' people and their relationships with neighboring peoples. The Rabinal Achí is performed during the Rabinal festival of January 25, the day of Saint Paul. It was declared a masterpiece of oral tradition of humanity by UNESCO in 2005. The 16th century saw the first native-born Guatemalan writers that wrote in Spanish. Major writers of this era include Sor Juana de Maldonado, considered the first poet-playwright of colonial Central America, and the historian Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán. The Jesuit Rafael Landívar (1731–1793) is considered as the first great Guatemalan poet. He was forced into exile by Carlos III. He traveled to Mexico and later to Italy, where he did. He originally wrote his Rusticatio Mexicana and his poems praising the bishop Figueredo y Victoria in Latin. The Maya people are known for their brightly colored yarn-based textiles, which are woven into capes, shirts, blouses, huipiles and dresses. Each village has its own distinctive pattern, making it possible to distinguish a person's home town on sight. Women's clothing consists of a shirt and a long skirt. Roman Catholicism combined with the indigenous Maya religion is the unique syncretic religion which prevailed throughout the country and still does in the rural regions. Beginning from negligible roots prior to 1960, however, Protestant Pentecostalism has grown to become the predominant religion of Guatemala City and other urban centers and down to mid-sized towns. The unique religion is reflected in the local saint, Maximón, who is associated with the subterranean force of masculine fertility and prostitution. Always depicted in black, he wears a black hat and sits on a chair, often with a cigar placed in his mouth and a gun in his hand, with offerings of tobacco, alcohol and Coca-Cola at his feet. The locals know him as San Simon of Guatemala. Nicaragua Nicaraguan culture has several distinct strands. The Pacific coast has strong folklore, music and religious traditions, deeply influenced by European culture but enriched with Amerindian and West African sounds/flavors. The Pacific coast of the country was colonized by Spain and has a similar culture to other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. The Caribbean coast of the country, on the other hand, was once a British protectorate. English is still predominant in this region and spoken domestically along with Spanish and indigenous languages. Its culture is similar to that of Caribbean nations that were or are British possessions, such as Jamaica, Belize, The Cayman Islands, etc. Nicaraguan music is a mixture of indigenous, West African and European, especially Spanish and to a lesser extent German, influences. The latter was a result of the German migration to the central-north regions of Las Segovias where Germans settled and brought with them polka music which influenced and evolved into Nicaraguan mazurka, polka and waltz. The Germans that migrated to Nicaragua are speculated to have been from the regions of Germany which were annexed to present-day Poland following the Second World War; hence the genres of mazurka, polka in addition to the waltz. One of the more famous composers of classical music and Nicaraguan waltz was José de la Cruz Mena who was actually not from the northern regions of Nicaragua but rather from the city of Leon in Nicaragua. More nationally identified, however, are musical instruments such as the marimba which is also common across Central America. The marimba of Nicaragua is uniquely played by a sitting performer holding the instrument on his knees. It is usually accompanied by a bass fiddle, guitar and guitarrilla (a small guitar like a mandolin). This music is played at social functions as a sort of background music. The marimba is made with hardwood plates, placed over bamboo or metal tubes of varying lengths. It is played with two or four hammers. The Caribbean coast of Nicaragua is known for a lively, sensual form of dance music called Palo de Mayo. It is especially loud and celebrated during the Palo de Mayo festival in May The Garifuna community exists in Nicaragua and is known for its popular music called Punta. Literature of Nicaragua can be traced to pre-Columbian times with the myths and oral literature that formed the cosmogonic view of the world that indigenous people had. Some of these stories are still known in Nicaragua. Like many Latin American countries, the Spanish conquerors and African slaves have had the most effect on both the culture and the literature. Nicaraguan literature is among the most important in Spanish language, with world-famous writers such as Rubén Darío who is regarded as the most important literary figure in Nicaragua, referred to as the \"Father of Modernism\" for leading the modernismo literary movement at the end of the 19th century. El Güegüense is a satirical drama and was the first literary work of post-Columbian Nicaragua. It is regarded as one of Latin America's most distinctive colonial-era expressions and as Nicaragua's signature folkloric masterpiece combining music, dance and theater. The theatrical play was written by an anonymous author in the 16th century, making it one of the oldest indigenous theatrical/dance works of the Western Hemisphere. The story was published in a book in 1942 after many centuries. South America Andean states The Andes Region comprises roughly much of what is now Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia, and was the seat of the Inca Empire in the pre-Columbian era. As such, many of the traditions date back to Incan traditions. During the independization of the Americas many countries including Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador and Panama formed what was known as Gran Colombia, a federal republic that later dissolved, however, the people in these countries believe each other to be their brothers and sisters and as such share many traditions and festivals. Peru and Bolivia were also one single country until Bolivia declared its independence, nevertheless, both nations are close neighbors that have somewhat similar cultures. Bolivia and Peru both still have significant Native American populations (primarily Quechua and Aymara) which mixed Spanish cultural elements with their ancestors' traditions. The Spanish-speaking population mainly follows the Western customs. Important archaeological ruins, gold and silver ornaments, stone monuments, ceramics, and weavings remain from several important pre-Columbian cultures. Major Bolivian ruins include Tiwanaku, Samaipata, Incallajta, and Iskanwaya. The majority of the Ecuadorian population is mestizo, a mixture of both European and Amerindian ancestry, and much like their ancestry, the national culture is also a blend of these two sources, along with influences from slaves from Africa in the coastal region. 95% of Ecuadorians are Roman Catholic. Peru Peruvian culture is primarily rooted in Amerindian and Spanish traditions, though it has also been influenced by various African, Asian, and a European ethnic group. Peruvian artistic traditions date back to the elaborate pottery, textiles, jewelry, and sculpture of Pre-Inca cultures. The Incas maintained these crafts and made architectural achievements including the construction of Machu Picchu. Baroque art dominated in colonial times, though it was modified by native traditions. During this period, most art focused on religious subjects; the numerous churches of the era and the paintings of the Cuzco School are representative. Arts stagnated after independence until the emergence of Indigenismo in the early 20th century. Since the 1950s, Peruvian art has been eclectic and shaped by both foreign and local art currents. Peruvian literature has its roots in the oral traditions of pre-Columbian civilizations. Spaniards introduced writing in the 16th century, and colonial literary expression included chronicles and religious literature. After independence, Costumbrism and Romanticism became the most common literary genres, as exemplified in the works of Ricardo Palma. In the early 20th century, the Indigenismo movement produced such writers as Ciro Alegría, José María Arguedas, and César Vallejo. During the second half of the century, Peruvian literature became more widely known because of authors such as Mario Vargas Llosa, a leading member of the Latin American Boom. Peruvian cuisine is a blend of Amerindian and Spanish food with strong influences from African, Arab, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese cooking. Common dishes include anticuchos, ceviche, humitas, and pachamanca. Because of the variety of climates within Peru, a wide range of plants and animals are available for cooking. Peruvian cuisine has recently received acclaim due to its diversity of ingredients and techniques. Peruvian music has Andean, Spanish and African roots. In pre-Columbian times, musical expressions varied widely from region to region; the quena and the tinya were two common instruments. Spanish conquest brought the introduction of new instruments such as the guitar and the harp, as well as the development of crossbred instruments like the charango. African contributions to Peruvian music include its rhythms and the cajón, a percussion instrument. Peruvian folk dances include the marinera, tondero and huayno. Colombia The culture of Colombia lies at the crossroads of Latin America. Thanks partly to geography, Colombian culture has been heavily fragmented into five major cultural regions. Rural to urban migration and globalization have changed how many Colombians live and express themselves as large cities become melting pots of people (many of whom are refugees) from the various provinces. According to a study in late 2004 by the Erasmus University in Rotterdam, Colombians are one of the happiest people in the world; this despite its four-decade long armed conflict involving the government, paramilitaries, drug lords, corruption and guerrillas like the FARC and ELN. Many aspects of Colombian culture can be traced back to the culture of Spain of the 16th century and its collision with Colombia's native civilizations (see: Muisca, Tayrona). The Spanish brought Catholicism, African slaves, the feudal encomienda system, and a caste system that favored European-born whites. After independence from Spain, the criollos struggled to establish a pluralistic political system between conservative and liberal ideals. Ethno-racial groups maintained their ancestral heritage culture: whites tried to keep themselves, despite the growing number of illegitimate children of mixed African or indigenous ancestry. These people were labeled with any number of descriptive names, derived from the casta system, such as mulato and moreno. Blacks and indigenous people of Colombia also mixed to form zambos creating a new ethno-racial group in society. This mix also created a fusion of cultures. Carnivals for example became an opportunity for all classes and colors to congregate without prejudice. The introduction of the bill of rights of men and the abolishment of slavery (1850) eased the segregationist tensions between the races, but the dominance of the whites prevailed and prevails to some extent to this day. The industrial revolution arrived relatively late at the beginning of the 20th century with the establishment of the Republic of Colombia. Colombians had a period of almost 50 years of relative peace interrupted only by a short armed conflict with Peru over the town of Leticia in 1932. Bogotá, the principal city, was the World Book Capital in 2007, in 2008 by the Iberoamerican Theatrum Festival Bogotá has been proclaimed as the world capital of theatre. Venezuela Venezuelan culture has been shaped by indigenous, African and especially European Spanish. Before this period, indigenous culture was expressed in art (petroglyphs), crafts, architecture (shabonos), and social organization. Aboriginal culture was subsequently assimilated by Spaniards; over the years, the hybrid culture had diversified by region. At present the Indian influence is limited to a few words of vocabulary and gastronomy. The African influence in the same way, in addition to musical instruments like the drum. The Spanish influence was more important and in particular came from the regions of Andalusia and Extremadura, places of origin of most settlers in the Caribbean during the colonial era. As an example of this can include buildings, part of the music, the Catholic religion and language. Spanish influences are evident bullfights and certain features of the cuisine. Venezuela also enriched by other streams of Indian and European origin in the 19th century, especially France. In the last stage of the great cities and regions entered the U.S. oil source and demonstrations of the new immigration of Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, increasing the already complex cultural mosaic. For example: From the United States comes the influence of the taste of baseball and modern architectural structures Venezuelan art is gaining prominence. Initially dominated by religious motifs, it began emphasizing historical and heroic representations in the late 19th century, a move led by Martín Tovar y Tovar. Modernism took over in the 20th century. Notable Venezuelan artists include Arturo Michelena, Cristóbal Rojas, Armando Reverón, Manuel Cabré, the kinetic artists Jesús-Rafael Soto and Carlos Cruz-Diez. Since the middle of the 20th century, artists such as Jacobo Borges, Régulo Perez, Pedro León Zapata, Harry Abend, Mario Abreu, Pancho Quilici, Carmelo Niño and Angel Peña emerged. They created a new plastic language. The 80s produced artist as Carlos Zerpa, Ernesto León, Miguel Von Dangel, Mateo Manaure, Patricia Van Dalen, Mercedes Elena Gonzalez, Zacarías García and Manuel Quintana Castillo. In more recent times, Venezuela produced a new diverse generation of innovating painters. Some of them are: Alejandro Bello, Edgard Álvarez Estrada, Gloria Fiallo, Felipe Herrera, Alberto Guacache and Morella Jurado. Venezuelan literature originated soon after the Spanish conquest of the mostly pre-literate indigenous societies; it was dominated by Spanish influences. Following the rise of political literature during the War of Independence, Venezuelan Romanticism, notably expounded by Juan Vicente González, emerged as the first important genre in the region. Although mainly focused on narrative writing, Venezuelan literature was advanced by poets such as Andrés Eloy Blanco and Fermín Toro. Major writers and novelists include Rómulo Gallegos, Teresa de la Parra, Arturo Uslar Pietri, Adriano González León, Miguel Otero Silva, and Mariano Picón Salas. The great poet and humanist Andrés Bello was also an educator and intellectual. Others, such as Laureano Vallenilla Lanz and José Gil Fortoul, contributed to Venezuelan Positivism. Carlos Raúl Villanueva was the most important Venezuelan architect of the modern era; he designed the Central University of Venezuela, (a World Heritage Site) and its Aula Magna. Other notable architectural works include the Capitol, the Baralt Theatre, the Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex, and the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge. Baseball and football are Venezuela's most popular sports, and the Venezuela national football team, is passionately followed. Famous Venezuelan baseball players include Luis Aparicio (inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame), David (Dave) Concepción, Oswaldo (Ozzie) Guillén (current White Sox manager, World Series champion in 2005), Freddy Garcia, Andrés Galarraga, Omar Vizquel (an eleven-time Gold Glove winner), Luis Sojo, Miguel Cabrera, Bobby Abreu, Félix Hernández, Magglio Ordóñez, Ugueth Urbina, and Johan Santana (a two-time unanimously selected Cy Young Award winner). Brazil Theatre In the 19th century, Brazilian theatre began with romanticism along with a fervour for political independence. During this time, racial issues were discussed in contradictory terms, but even so, there were some significant plays, including a series of popular comedies by Martins Penna, França Junior, and Arthur Azevedo. In the 20th century, the two most important production centers for professional theatre were São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. They were centers of industrial and economic development. Even with the development of these two theatres, World War I brought an end to tours by European theatres so there were no productions in Brazil during this time. In November 1927, Alvaro Moreyra founded the Toy Theatre (Teatro de Brinquedo). Like this company, it was in the late 1920s when the first stable theatre companies formed around well-known actors. These actors were able to practice authentic Brazilian gestures gradually freed from Portuguese influence. Except for some political criticism in the low comedies, the dramas of this period were not popular. Occasionally the question of dependence on Europe or North America has raised. Even with more Latin American influence of theatre starting to filter in, its theatre still was under the heavy influence of Europe. The Brazilian Comedy Theatre (Teatro Brasileiro de Comédia) was created in 1948 Oswald de Andrade wrote three plays; The King of the Candle (O Rei da Vela, 1933), The Man and the Horse (O Homem e o Cavalo, 1934). and The Dead Woman (A Morta, 1937). They were an attempt to deal with political themes, nationalism, and anti-imperialism. His theatre was inspired by Meyerhold's and Brecht's theories, with a political sarcasm like Mayakovsky. 1943 at The Comedians: Polish director and refugee from the Nazis, Zbigniew Ziembinsky, staged in expressionist style Nelson Rodrigues' A Bride's Gown (Vestido de Noiva). With this production, Brazilian theatre moved into the modem period at Theatre Brasileiro de Commedia (Brazilian Comedy Theater). World War II saw Brazil gain several foreign directors, especially from Italy, who wanted to make a theatre free from nationalistic overtones. Paradoxically, this led to a second renewal that engaged popular forms and sentiments; a renewal that was decidedly nationalistic with social point of view. During this time, the Stanislavsky system of acting was most popular and widely used. Stanislavski himself came to Brazil via Eugenio Kusnet, a Russian actor who had met him at the Moscow Art Theatre. The next phase was from 1958 to the signing of the Institutional Act Number Five in 1968. It marked the end of freedom and democracy. These ten years were the most productive of the century. During these years dramaturgy matured through the plays of Guarnieri, Vianinha, Boal, Dias Gomes, and Chico de Assis, as did mise-en-scene in the work of Boal, Jost Celso Martinez Correa, Flavio Rangel, and Antunes Filho. During this decade a generation accepted theatre as an activity with social responsibility. At its height, this phase of Brazilian theatre was characterized by an affirmation of national values. Actors and directors became political activists who risked their jobs and lives daily. Through this growth of Latin America politically and the influence of European theatre, an identity of what is theatre in Latin America stemmed out of it. Modern painting Modern painting in Brazil was born during Modern Art Week in 1922. Artists who have excelled in 20th century Brazilian art include Tarsila do Amaral, Emiliano Di Cavalcanti, and Candido Portinari. Portinari was influenced by Cubism and Expressionism and is the painter of War and Peace, a panel at the United Nations in New York. Photography Brazilian contemporary photography is one of the most creative in Latin America, growing in international prominence each year with exhibitions and publications. Photographers like Miguel Rio Branco, Vik Muniz, Sebastião Salgado, and Guy Veloso have received recognition.

{"text": "The Sydney Jewish Museum is a history museum located in the Sydney suburb of Darlinghurst. It showcases exhibits relating to the Holocaust, the history and achievements of Jewish people in Australia, and issues of social justice, democracy and human rights in an Australian context. Emphasis is placed on documenting the lived experiences and individual stories of Holocaust survivors and Jewish-Australians, through the presentation of personal objects and testimonies. History Prior usage of the site The museum is housed in the historic Maccabean Hall, and was originally built to commemorate the contributions of the Jewish community from New South Wales who served in World War I. This building was formally opened on Armistice Day 1923 by Jewish-Australian civil engineer and Australian Army commander General Sir John Monash. Before it was chosen as the location for the museum, it served as a hub for Jewish life in Sydney. Establishment The Sydney Jewish Museum was established in 1992 by Holocaust survivors who came to Australia and was officially opened by Rear Admiral Peter Sinclair , the Governor of New South Wales, on 18 November 1992. The museum was founded by the late John Saunders and members of the Australian Association of Jewish Holocaust Survivors. Australia has a higher proportion of Holocaust survivors (per capita) than any country except Israel. Resource Centre and Library The museum library was created from the entire collection of books donated by Australian Association of Jewish Holocaust Survivors. Since then, the Resource Centre and Library has grown to over 6000 volumes, journals, audio and videotapes, including over 2,500 personal testimonies of Holocaust survivors in Australia. The centre is open to the public during museum hours and staffed by a librarian. The collection provides material for the exhibitions and covers a wide range of themes including antisemitism, war crimes, the holocaust in art and literature, and Australian Jewish history.

{"text": "Luing cattle (pronounced ling cattle) are a beef breed developed on the island of Luing in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland by the Cadzow brothers in 1947. It was formed by first crossbreeding Beef Shorthorn with Highland cattle and then breeding the resulting progeny with Beef Shorthorns to produce an animal three quarters Beef Shorthorn, one quarter Highland. The breed of red-brown cattle are moderately sized and extremely hardy. The intent was to produce a good beef cow with the ability to raise a calf under adverse weather conditions. It was officially recognised as a breed by the British government in 1965. The breed is still farmed today, mainly in Scotland but also in other areas of the world. History Luings were first created by the Cadzow brothers; Ralph, Denis and Shane, in 1947. They crossbred two types of cattle to produce the Luing; the Highland as the heifer and the Beef Shorthorn as the bull, and were the first new breed of cattle developed in Britain in over 100 years. The Highland was chosen as it contributes the hardiness that we see in the breed today and the Shorthorn because of its fleshing qualities and flavour of meat. Through a breeding programme, the three sons established the breed that we have today. In 1965, the breed was officially recognised by the British Government. Today The Cadzow family continue to farm on Luing and the breed remains popular on the surrounding isles, including Scarba and Torsa. The breed has been exported to countries across the world including Canada and New Zealand, and is highly regarded for hardiness and ease of handling and marbling of its meat. Characteristics The average Luing cow will give birth to 10 calves in a lifetime because of their longevity. This has been attributed to the traits inherited from their Highland cattle ancestors. They typically have hair of a medium length and a red or dun coloured coat.

{"text": "Practice research aka practice as research, practice based research or/and practitioner researcher is a form of academic research which incorporates practice in the methodology or research output. Rather than seeing the relationship between practice and theory as a dichotomy, as has sometimes traditionally been the case (see academia: theory and practice heading), there is a growing body of practice research academics across a number of disciplines who use practice as part of their research. For example, the practice-based research network (PBRN) within clinical medical research. Practice-led research in the arts and design Within arts and humanities departments there are ongoing debates about how to define this emerging research phenomenon, and there are a variety of models of practice research (practice-as-research, practice-based, practice-led, mixed-mode research practice and practice through research), see for example screen media practice research. The potential, nature and scope for this research has been debated from the 1990s. Sir Christopher Frayling in 1993 adapted Herbert Read's model of education through art to describe different ways of thinking about research, noting that research could be for practice, where research aims are subservient to practice aims, through practice, where the practice serves a research purpose, or into practice, such as observing the working processes of others. Bruce Archer's statement in 1995 shows the growing recognition of arts practice as research at this time, \"There are circumstances where the best or only way to shed light on a proposition, a principle, a material, a process or a function is to attempt to construct something, or to enact something, calculated to explore, embody or test it.\" This led to the acceptance of practice research in these disciplines to be reviewed alongside traditional research disciplines in the sphere of Higher Education a debate supported by the work of Michael Biggs, John Freeman, Kristina Niedderer, Katy Macleod, Darren Newbury and others. The UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council had a steering committee devoted to practice-led research and its report was completed in September 2007, titled AHRC Research Review in Practice-Led Research in Art, Design and Architecture. This informed continuing discussions by the Council for Higher Education in Art & Design (CHEAD) and the AHRC resulting in an evolved notion of practice as research in art, design and architecture, media, and creative writing. This in turn brought an increasing recognition in the UK of the ways in which creative departments contribute to research culture, a potential which informs elements of the Research Excellence Framework 2014.

History The second independent music club recognized by the university, the Crosbys were founded in 1983 and remain the only TTBB a cappella singing group at Binghamton University. Like many collegiate a cappella groups, they are rooted in traditions tied to certain social events, attire, or means of address. The Crosbys usually perform in jeans and blazers; their alumni song — a collegiate a cappella tradition in which alumni present at the concert may join current members to sing — is \"Strike Up the Band\" (aka Jack). They undertake a two-week tour each winter, succeeded by The Jam, a large performance at the end of each semester. The Crosbys typically compete in the ICCA competition every few years, as do many prestigious collegiate a cappella groups. They have progressed to the national championship round four times in the twenty-five years of the ICCA's existence, performing at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and winning the trophy during the finals held in 2003 at the Beacon Theatre on Broadway. They have also won many other awards at this competition, such as Best Soloist, Best Arrangement and Best Choreography. In 1985, under the pseudonym Cliffs Notes (in honor of then school president Clifford Clark), the group was chosen as the winner of the campus-held Maxwell House Talent Competition for their performance of \"Only You\", which was to become a signature song of the group.

{"text": "Oshea Wilder (1784–1846) was an early pioneer to southwest Michigan. Born 16 July 1784 in Gardner, Massachusetts to Elijah and Azubah (Wells) Wilder, he initially made his living as a blacksmith before entering the military to fight in the War of 1812. On 4 February 1813, Wilder married Cornelia Anthony (1791–1866), daughter of John and Sarah (Shaw) Anthony. In the 1820s, they toured Europe, settling in New York and Paterson, New Jersey upon their return to the United States. Wilder was active with the Presbyterian Church, and was a founding member of the First Presbyterian Church in Paterson. Michigan Pioneer In 1831, the Wilders pioneered the area around present-day Marshall, Michigan in Calhoun County where Oshea worked as a land surveyor. The same year, the Ketchum Brothers arrived from New York, and Wilder assisted them in the founding of the village of Marshall. By 1835, the Village of Marshall had a population of 300. In 1834, Michigan territorial governor Stevens T. Mason appointed him to a three-person committee to determine Allegan County's county seat. In 1836, he purchased a plot of land in Allegan County, along the shore of Lake Michigan. On that land, and with the support of Lancaster Bank of Massachusetts, he established the village of Singapore. One early feature of the town was that it had its own bank. Michigan law required that banks have funds enough on hand to cover at least 1/3 of bank notes that it printed. By 1838, over $50,000 in Singapore Bank notes had been placed in circulation. Wilder deserted the town in 1846, moving back to Calhoun County. James Carter of New York bought out Wilder's interest in the town and moved there to oversee his investment. Wilder died in Eckford, Michigan 6 November 1847.

{"text": "Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a type of muscular dystrophy, a group of heritable diseases that cause progressive impairment of muscles. EDMD affects muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles), causing atrophy, weakness and contractures. It almost always affects the heart, causing abnormal rhythms, heart failure, or sudden cardiac death. It is rare, affecting 0.39 per 100,000 (1 per 250,000) people. It is named after Alan Eglin H. Emery and Fritz E. Dreifuss. Classification Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy can be sub-classified by pattern of inheritance: X-linked, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive. Autosomal dominant: heart problems with weakness (and wasting) of skeletal muscles and Achilles tendon contractures. X-linked: result of the EMD gene mutation, characterized by cardiac involvement. Autosomal recessive: characterized by cardiac issues, such as arrhythmia. Signs and symptoms The classic triad of EDMD consists of early contractures, muscle weakness, and heart involvement, typically manifesting in adolescence. Contractures often manifest before weakness, and they can be more disabling. They tend to fix the elbow into flexion and ankle into plantarflexion via Achilles tendon shortening. The spine is also affected, with limited neck flexion initially, and eventually the entire spine can become fixed into extension, referred to as a rigid spine. Elbow and neck contractures seldom occur in other diseases. Eventually, orthopedics (walker, cane) may be needed. The weakness is slowly progressive and preferentially involves the muscles that overlie the humerus bone (biceps and triceps muscles) and those situated on the outside of the lower leg (peroneal). Later, the muscles that position the scapula can be weakened, completing a pattern that is termed 'scapulohumeroperoneal'. Weakness of the scapular fixators can cause a winged scapula, which can impair the ability to lift the arms over the head and can be painful. Weakness of the peroneal muscles can result in toe walking, which can present in the first decade of life. Facial, hand, and thigh muscles can be affected, although less often. Calf hypertrophy can occur. Involvement of the heart occurs in almost all cases, presenting as syncope in second or third decades, or as sudden cardiac death. A multitude of cardiac arrhythmias can result, requiring a pacemaker often by age 30 years. Reported arrhythmias include bradycardia, atrial fibrillation/flutter, atrioventricular conduction defect, and atrial paralysis. Later in the disease, cardiomyopathy can occur. Sometimes, cardiac involvement is the predominant manifestation of EDMD, with minimal involvement of the skeletal muscles. EDMD1 Skeletal muscle involvement usually occurs before cardiac involvement. Of female carriers, 10-20% have abnormal heart rhythm or conduction, with increased risk of sudden cardiac death. EDMD2 Disease course of EDMD 2 is more severe than EDMD1. Compared to EDMD1, cardiac symptoms are more likely to be the initial manifestation. EDMD2 can result in a much broader spectrum of disease, and the severity of muscle weakness is less predictable. However, muscle weakness typically is slowly progressive in first three decades, with an increased rate of progression thereafter. Genetics Mutations in the one of several genes cause the various types of Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Mutation of the EMD or LMNA gene is the cause in 40% of cases. Each gene implicated in EDMD provides instructions for making a protein that is associated with the nuclear envelope, which surrounds the nucleus of a cell. The nuclear envelope regulates the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus, and researchers believe it may play a role in regulating the activity of certain genes. Mutations of the genes SUN1 and SUN2 have each been shown to cause EDMD in single cases. TTN has also been associated with EDMD phenotype. Pathophysiology Genetic mutations causing EDMD affect proteins comprising the nuclear membrane. Possibly, in all EDMD subtypes there is impaired protein importation into the nucleus. Another possibility is that in all subtypes, there is a loss of nuclear structural integrity. Diagnosis A positive genetic test in a person with the signs and symptoms of EDMD provides definitive diagnosis. Genetic testing can involve single-gene testing or genomic testing. Auxiliary testing can include the following: Differential diagnosis Contractures manifest early in the disease course. Other diseases that have early or congenital contractures are diseases involving collagen mutations, including Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and Bethlem myopathy. SEPN1-related myopathy and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita also cause congenital contractures. Weakness initially affects the humeral and peroneal muscles, progressing to involve the scapular and pelvic muscles. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy has a similar muscle involvement pattern. Management Following diagnosis, extent of disease should be established in regards to the heart, the lungs, and the muscles/bones (musculoskeletal). Metabolic functions should also be assessed, as lipodystrophy can co-occur with EDMD, by measuring levels of sugar, cholesterol, and triglycerides in the blood. Tests useful for heart evaluation include electrocardiography (EKG), echocardiography (echo), cardiac MRI, and electrophysiology studies. Musculoskeletal function can be assessed by a physical therapist or orthopedist. Regardless of extent of disease, cardiac and respiratory complications should be monitored for. EKG, holter, and echo are recommended yearly, and additional tests can be indicated depending on heart involvement. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are recommended every 2–3 years, or yearly in those with respiratory involvement. Although the root cause of EDMD is not currently treatable, its manifestations and complications can be treated. Heart involvement can be addressed with medications (antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors), pacemakers, defibrillators, and sometimes heart transplantation. Affecting breathing can be addressed with physical therapy and, later in disease, mechanical ventilation. Contractures and scoliosis can be addressed with orthopedic surgery. Mobility can be improved with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and mechanical aids (canes, orthoses, wheelchairs). Epidemiology It is rare, affecting 0.39 per 100,000 (1 per 250,000) people.

{"text": "SS Tahoe was a steamship that operated on Lake Tahoe at the end of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th. Scuttled in 1940, the wreck presently lies in of water off Glenbrook, Nevada. The wreck was first visited in 2002 by a team from New Millennium Dive Expeditions (NMDE) in a record-setting high-altitude dive for Lake Tahoe. As a result of the work that NMDE did on the Tahoe site from 1999 up to their dives in 2002, Tahoe became the first maritime site in Nevada to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Service history By the end of the 19th century, Lake Tahoe had become known as a vacation resort, with a handful of hotels and communities scattered around its shores, serviced by a number of steamers crossing the lake. Lumber magnate Duane Leroy Bliss ordered the vessel from San Francisco's Union Iron Works in 1894. The design of the Tahoe was carried out by Union Iron Works marine architect H. P. Freer, while the vessel's powerplant, propulsion and steering was handled by mechanical designer Knut Dahl. Due to the vessel's narrow beam of just 17 feet, the propulsion and steering required special attention. Freer and Dahl angled the ship's propeller shafts outwards by five degrees to prevent the propellers from overlapping one another; this had the added bonus of reducing the vessel's turning radius. In addition, the rudder was hinged approximately 1/3 to the aft in order to reduce the amount of effort needed to turn the helm to place the rudder inside the propeller wash and effect a turn. One unique feature of this design was the need to (counterintuitively) advance the throttles on the port engine to effect a turn to port, due to the close spacing of the propellers. The 154-ton hull was subdivided into eight watertight compartments to enhance safety and survivability. The hull of the Tahoe was fabricated in sections at the Union Iron Works shipyard's San Francisco Pier 70 as Boat #42 in December 1895, which were then disassembled and packaged for transport. The components were then shipped by rail flatcar in pieces to Carson City, then by wagon over Spooner Summit to Glenbrook, reassembled, and launched with much acclaim on June 24, 1896. At , Tahoe was the largest of the lake steamers; she was propelled by two wood-fired engines developing a total of , each driving a three-bladed brass propeller at a maximum of 353 RPM up to 18.5 knots. The engines burned approximately 4.5 cords of wood per day, though at some time in her history the ship was converted to burn oil instead of wood. Her 200 passengers enjoyed a well-appointed interior finished with teakwood and mahogany, along with leather upholstery, polished brass fittings, carpeting, and marble fixtures in the lavatories. Modern technologies included 65 electric lights and bells, hot and cold running water, and steam heating in both the forward and aft passenger cabins. At the forward end of the superstructure was a men-only smoking lounge, while directly aft was a dining hall capable of seating thirty people. Crew quarters were located below decks in the ship's stern. From 1901, Tahoe operated from a railroad pier in Tahoe City during the summer, leaving in the morning, making a daily 73-mile circuit of the shoreline communities, and returning in the late afternoon. In addition to the passengers, she carried freight and mail, which were loaded in the morning before being distributed as the ship circuited Lake Tahoe. The completion of a road suitable for cars all around the lake in 1934-35, followed by the loss of the mail contract in 1934 to Marian B, made Tahoe uneconomical to operate, and she lay unused for several years. In 1940, Bliss's son William Seth Bliss repurchased the vessel from the operating company; his intent was to scuttle her in shallow water off Glenbrook as a memorial to a bygone era, visible to glass-bottomed boats. Tahoe was scuttled on August 29, 1940, but the underwater slope was unexpectedly steep at the chosen location, and the ship slid down out of sight, ending up with the bow at and the stern at . Wreck discovery In 2002, the Reno-based non-profit organization New Millennium Dive Expeditions set a record for high altitude scuba diving when they reached the wreck of Tahoe. The information they gathered on the wreck was a crucial part of the documentation enabling Tahoe to be listed on the National Register. The work of the NMDE team continued in 2009 where in August and September they visited the wreck again successfully in preparation for three visits in the summer of 2010. In July 2016 the vessel was filmed by an underwater drone or remote vehicle as part of a project to develop such devices cheaply.

{"text": "Mladen Petrić (; born 1 January 1981) is a retired professional footballer who played as a forward or striker. During his career, he played for Grasshopper, Basel, Borussia Dortmund, Hamburger SV, Fulham, West Ham United and Panathinaikos. Born in Socialist Bosnia, he represented Switzerland on youth levels internationally before opting for Croatia on senior level. Early life Petrić was born in the village of Dubrave near Brčko, Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia. Petrić moved with his family to Vinkovci and then later to Neuenhof, Switzerland, where he started to play football at the local club FC Neuenhof before moving to FC Baden and starting his professional career at the club in the summer of 1998. He left Baden after one season and went on to sign with Grasshopper Club Zürich in the summer of 1999. Club career Grasshopper Club Petrić signed for Grasshopper Club ahead of the 1999–2000 Nationalliga A season. At that time GC was the clear number one in Switzerland, and foreign players were often brought in for positions up front. This was particularly pronounced under head coach Roy Hodgson, therefore Petrić had a difficult time. In the next season Hans-Peter Zaugg was appointed as new head coach and Petrić came to regular appearances and in his first five games scored three goals. At the end of the 2000–01 Swiss Football League season Petrić won the championship with GC. In the 2001–02 season GC were runners-up behind FC Basel and reached the Swiss Cup final. In the final Petrić scored the equaliser, after Basel had taken an early lead. The match went into extra time, but FCB won 2–1 and thus the trophy. At the end of the 2002–03 Nationalliga A season, Petrić won his second championship with GC. But he received much criticism because of an action during the Swiss Championship celebrations, in which he burned a Basel scarf. In the 2003–04 season GC again reached the cup final, this time they were defeated 3–2 by Wil. Petrić left the club in the summer of 2004. During his time playing for GC, he made a total of 114 domestic league appearances and scored 30 league goals for the club. Basel Petrić was acquired for a transfer fee of approximate €3 million and he signed a four-year contract until June 2008. He joined Basel's first team during their 2004–05 season under head coach Christian Gross and Petrić was persuaded to join FCB by him. After playing in seven test games he played his domestic league debut for his new club in the home game in the St. Jakob-Park on 17 July 2004 as Basel won 6–0 against Aarau. He scored his first goal for with the team in the away game in the Stadion Lachen on 22 September. But this goal could not help the team, as Basel were defeated 4–1 by Thun. However Petrić suffered an injury in February 2005 and he then missed the rest of the season. Basel completed all the 2004–05 Super League season's seventeen home games undefeated, winning thirteen and drawing four. They ended the season as Swiss champions with 10 points advantage over second placed Thun. Petrić had 22 appearances, scoring five league goals. As Swiss champions, Basel entered the 2005–06 Champions League third qualifying round. However, they were drawn against German Bundesliga club Werder Bremen and they lost 4–2 on aggregate. Subsequently Basel dropped into the 2005–06 UEFA Cup, where against NK Široki Brijeg in the first round, second leg, Petrić scored his first European and the team sealed a 6–0 aggregate win to qualify for the Group stage. Here Basel were then drawn into Group E, alongside Strasbourg, Roma, Red Star Belgrade and Tromsø. Basel qualified for the knock-out stage and in the round of 32 Basel were drawn against AS Monaco, this was won 2–1 on aggregate. In the round of 16, Basel were drawn against Strasbourgh winning 4–2 on aggregate. In the quarter-finals, drawn against Middlesbrough they won the first leg 2–0, but Middlesbrough fought back to win the return match 4–1 and the tie 4–3 on aggregate. Petrić played in 13 of these 14 European games, scoring three goals. Basel started into the 2005–06 Super League season well and led the championship right until the last day of the league campaign. Petrić scored a hat-trick for the team on 2 October 2005 in the home game in the St. Jakob-Park as Basel won 5–1 against Thun. On the final day of the league season, Basel played at home against Zürich. Petrić had scored an equaliser after FCZ had taken an early lead. A last-minute goal from Zürich's Iulian Filipescu meant the final score was 1–2 in favour of the away team and it gave FCZ their first national championship since 1980–81. The title for Basel was lost on goal difference. Petrić was fourth-leading goal scorer of the Swiss Super League for the 2005–06 season, scoring 14 goals in 31 matches. The last minute loss of the Championship and the subsequent riots, the so-called Basel Hooligan Incident, meant that the club would suffer the consequences. FC Basel's European campaign started in the first qualifying stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Cup, here they beat Kazakhi side FC Tobol 3–1 on aggregate. In the second qualifying round they were drawn against FC Vaduz from Liechtenstein, narrowly progressing on the away goals rule after a 2–2 aggregate draw. In the first round Basel won 7–2 on aggregate against FK Rabotnički to qualified for the group stage. Here Basel played their first match at home against Feyenoord, this ended in a 1–1 draw. Their second was away and FCB lost 3–0 against Blackburn Rovers. At home against AS Nancy the match was drawn 2–2 and the final game ended with a 3–1 defeat against Wisła Kraków. Basel ended the group stage in last position in the table and were eliminated. Petrić played in all ten of these matches. In the final moments of Basel's match against Nancy on 23 November 2006, Petrić was installed in goal after Basel's goalkeeper Franco Costanzo was sent off for a foul on Nancy's Issiar Dia and the team had already made all three substitutions. The foul resulted in a penalty kick that gave Nancy the final chance for an away victory, but Petrić was able to make a save and stopped the penalty kick taken by Mickaël Chrétien, helping his team to earn a point with a 2–2 draw. At the end of the 2006–07 Super League season, Basel were runners-up, one point behind championship winners Zürich. Petrić finished the season as the league's top goal scorer with 19 goals and was voted Player of the Year in a fan poll. In the Swiss Cup Basel advanced to the final, beating FC Liestal in the first round, Lugano, FC Baulmes, Aarau and Wil in the semi-final. In the final they played Luzern and won this 1–0 thanks to a penalty goal in the third minute of added time. Petrić played in all six cup games. Petrić left the club after that season, moving to Germany. During his three seasons with the club he played a total of 141 games for Basel scoring a total of 79 goals. 72 of these games were in the Swiss Super League, 11 in the Swiss Cup, 29 in the UEFA competitions (Champions League and UEFA Cup) and 29 were friendly games. He scored 38 goals in the domestic league, four in the cup, eight in the European games and the other 29 were scored during the test games. Borussia Dortmund On 11 June 2007, Petrić signed for German Bundesliga team Borussia Dortmund, along with fellow Croatia national team player Robert Kovač, as part of the side's squad rebuilding. While originally being intended to act as a playmaker behind the forwards in a 4–4–2 diamond system, it quickly turned out that he was more effective as a striker up front. He enjoyed a strong start to the season, scoring a brace in Dortmund's 3–0 victory against Werder Bremen. He was one of the league's top scorers in his first season in Germany and also made a notable assistance to his side reaching the DFB-Pokal final in which he scored a stoppage time equaliser against eventual winners and champions Bayern Munich. Hamburg On 17 August 2008, Petrić's transfer from Dortmund to Hamburger SV was confirmed by both clubs' official websites as part of a deal that also saw Egyptian international Mohamed Zidan moving in the opposite direction, with both players signing four-year contracts. Dortmund also confirmed they have received an officially undisclosed transfer fee, which was believed to be worth around €5 million. Petrić made his Bundesliga debut for Hamburg on 23 August 2008 in their 2–1 win at home to Karlsruher SC, coming on as a substitute for Jonathan Pitroipa in the 73rd minute. He scored his first goal for the club on 13 September 2008, netting the winner in their 3–2 win against Bayer Leverkusen. In three consecutive matches in late September and early October 2008, Petrić scored all five goals in Hamburg's 2–0 victories over VfL Bochum in the DFB-Pokal and Unirea Urziceni in the UEFA Cup, as well as their 1–0 victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach in the Bundesliga. On 5 October 2008, he netted a last-minute winner in Hamburg's 2–1 away victory at Energie Cottbus to keep them top of the Bundesliga table. He scored in the Europa League semi-final against Fulham from a free-kick. However crucial the away goal was, Hamburg lost the tie on an aggregate score of 2–1 due to a goalless draw in the first leg in Hamburg. Towards the end of the 2011–12 Bundesliga campaign, it was revealed Petrić would leave Hamburg at the end of the season. Fulham After being released by Hamburg at the end of the 2011–12 campaign, Petrić signed a one-year deal with English Premier League club Fulham, linking up with former Hamburg boss, Martin Jol. The Croatian striker made his debut at home to Norwich City on the opening day of the Premier League campaign, along with fellow new signing Sascha Riether. Petrić scored a double and provided an assist for Alexander Kačaniklić as Fulham beat Norwich by a score of 5–0. Petrić was one of twelve players released by Fulham at the end of the 2012–13 Premier League season. West Ham United On 10 September 2013, Petrić joined West Ham United on a one-year deal. He made his debut on 21 September 2013 in a 3–2 home defeat by Everton coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute for Modibo Maïga. He made only three further appearances for the club before being released in December 2013. Panathinaikos On 8 January 2014, Greek club Panathinaikos announced the signing of Petrić on a one-and-a-half-year deal with \"The Greens.\" In Athens, he reunited with his old Hamburg teammate Marcus Berg as well as two of his teammates from the Croatia national team, Danijel Pranjić and Gordon Schildenfeld. On 16 February 2014, Petrić made his debut with the Greek club, coming from the bench against Panthrakikos in Komotini. On 4 May 2014, he scored his first goal for Panathinaikos in a play-off match against PAOK. On 22 February 2015, he scored against rival club Olympiacos in a 2–1 win. On 7 January 2016, he helped his club to escape with a 2–1 away win by scoring the winning goal against PAS Giannina for the Greek Cup. On 28 May 2016, he announced his retirement from professional football. On 12 October 2017, the veteran Croatian international striker has decided to legally demand the €210.000 that Panathinaikos still owe him, almost one and a half years after his official retirement. International career In 2001, Petrić was spotted in Switzerland by Mirko Jozić, head coach of the Croatia national team at the time, and made his international debut for Croatia during the team's South Korean tour in November 2001, where they played two friendly matches against the South Korean national team. Petrić appeared in both of the two matches as a second-half substitute, but was subsequently nevertheless not called up to be part of the Croatian squad at the 2002 World Cup finals. He scored his first goal for Croatia in their friendly match against Wales on 21 August 2002 in Varaždin, which ended in a 1–1 draw. He subsequently made his competitive international debut as a second-half substitute in Croatia's opening match of the Euro 2004 qualifying against Estonia, but did not play any international matches at the A-team level for three and half years following this match. In early 2006, Petrić made his international comeback with Croatia by appearing as a second-half substitute in the team's friendly matches against South Korea at the Carlsberg Cup in Hong Kong and Argentina in Basel. He was eventually omitted from the final 23-man squad for the 2006 World Cup finals, but received a pre-invitation. In early August 2006, he was called up by Croatia's new coach Slaven Bilić to be part of the team in their friendly match against Italy on 16 August 2006 in Livorno and appeared in the match as a second-half substitute. He was an active member with his national side in their Euro 2008 qualifying campaign, appearing in almost all of the team's qualifying matches. In the second qualifier, against Andorra on 7 October 2006 in Zagreb, he scored four goals in only 60 minutes of playing and became the first ever player to score four goals for Croatia in a competitive match. Croatia won the match 7–0, celebrating their then highest competitive victory ever. In the return leg against Andorra on 12 September 2007, he scored twice. On 21 November, the last day of Euro 2008 qualifiers, Petrić was brought on as a substitute in the away fixture against England. With Croatia already qualified and the match tied at 2–2, he scored the winning goal from about 25 yards from goal to knock England out of qualifying for Euro 2008. It was England's first competitive defeat at the New Wembley. After the match, he refused to swap his jersey, going on to say, \"It's the most valuable goal of my career and the best I've scored. I wouldn't swap my kit with any English player because I want to save it for myself.\" Because of his impressive qualifying campaign, he was named in Croatia's Euro 2008 squad. Croatia won their first round group, winning all their matches, including a win against later runners-up Germany, but were knocked out by Turkey in the quarter-finals after a penalty shoot-out. In 2012, he had not played a match for the national team. In February 2013, he played his last international match and scored a goal against South Korea.

{"text": "Żabno is a town and municipality on the river Dunajec in southern Poland, north of Tarnów. Since Poland's administrative reorganization in 1999, Żabno has been a part of Tarnów powiat which belongs to Lesser Poland Voivodeship. Before administrative reorganization in 1999 it belonged to the Tarnów Voivodeship. History First recorded mentioning of Żabno dates back to the 12th century, when Prince Bolesław V the Chaste granted the settlement to a knight known as Świętosław. It became a center of communication and trade, due to a convenient location along a merchant route from Wojnicz and Pilzno, to Opatowiec and Nowy Korczyn. It is not known when Żabno received its town charter. This must have happened before the year 1385, as on January 26 of that year, Queen Jadwiga of Poland, upon request of Spytek of Melsztyn, confirmed Żabno's Magdeburg rights. Little is known about town's early history, as few documents have been preserved. One of the few established facts is that in 1394, King Władysław Jagiełło visited the town with his court, on the way to Nowy Korczyn. In the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the town belonged to the Sandomierz Voivodeship, and was part of the County of Wiślica. By the 15th century there were two churches at Żabno, 'Church of the Holy Spirit' and the 'Church of the Holy Cross'. At the same time, first artisans opened their workshops here. Every week markets took place at Żabno, with the first one organized in the year 1487, after the town had received a royal privilege. The tradition of the markets still remains. The town was destroyed numerous times, in 1501 it was burned by the Tatars, and in 1656, it was completely destroyed in the Swedish invasion of Poland, when Transilvanian-Cossack army of George II Rakoczi, which was allied with the Swedish Empire, burned it to the ground. In 1772, after the first partition of Poland, Żabno became part of the Austrian province of Galicia, where it remained until late 1918. In 1799, a great fire burned almost all of the town. In the 19th century Żabno remained a small town, which in 1906 received a rail connection with Tarnów, due to a secondary-importance line from Tarnów to Szczucin. First local industrial facility was a brick making factory which opened in 1905. In the early 20th century the town began a slow process of development, which was stopped by World War I, when the frontline for several months remained along the Dunajec river, which brought widespread destruction. In the Second Polish Republic, Żabno belonged to Kraków Voivodeship. The town suffered greatly in the 1934 flood in Poland, and during World War II, around 2000 people were sent to a work in labor camps in Germany. 30 people were sent to a concentration camp during the war out of which only 4 returned. Żabno's Jewish community perished in the Holocaust. Modern Żabno The latest Census on December 31, 2006 gave the population as 4262 inhabitants. Currently Żabno is a town with a small-scale industrial capacity. Local industry mainly consists of metalworks and window manufacturing. The Tarnów-Szczucin railway runs through the town. There also is a provincial road nr. 973 to Tarnów. Żabno is home to a sports club Polan.

{"text": "High-resolution schemes are used in the numerical solution of partial differential equations where high accuracy is required in the presence of shocks or discontinuities. They have the following properties: Second- or higher-order spatial accuracy is obtained in smooth parts of the solution. Solutions are free from spurious oscillations or wiggles. High accuracy is obtained around shocks and discontinuities. The number of mesh points containing the wave is small compared with a first-order scheme with similar accuracy. General methods are often not adequate for accurate resolution of steep gradient phenomena; they usually introduce non-physical effects such as smearing of the solution or spurious oscillations. Since publication of Godunov's order barrier theorem, which proved that linear methods cannot provide non-oscillatory solutions higher than first order (, ), these difficulties have attracted much attention and a number of techniques have been developed that largely overcome these problems. To avoid spurious or non-physical oscillations where shocks are present, schemes that exhibit a Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) characteristic are especially attractive. Two techniques that are proving to be particularly effective are MUSCL (Monotone Upstream-Centered Schemes for Conservation Laws), a flux/slope limiter method (, , , , ) and the WENO (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory) method (, ). Both methods are usually referred to as high resolution schemes (see diagram). MUSCL methods are generally second-order accurate in smooth regions (although they can be formulated for higher orders) and provide good resolution, monotonic solutions around discontinuities. They are straightforward to implement and are computationally efficient. For problems comprising both shocks and complex smooth solution structure, WENO schemes can provide higher accuracy than second-order schemes along with good resolution around discontinuities. Most applications tend to use a fifth order accurate WENO scheme, whilst higher order schemes can be used where the problem demands improved accuracy in smooth regions. The method of holistic discretisation systematically analyses subgrid scale dynamics to algebraically construct closures for numerical discretisations that are both accurate to any specified order of error in smooth regions, and automatically adapt to cater for rapid grid variations through the algebraic learning of subgrid structures ().

{"text": "Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves and the American Revolution is a history book by Simon Schama. It was the 2006 National Book Critics Circle Award winner for general nonfiction. A 2007 drama-documentary television programme was based on it. Synopsis Rough Crossings gives an account of the history of thousands of African-American slaves who escaped slavery in the American colonies to fight for the British cause during the American Revolutionary War. It tells of the legal battles which established that slavery was not valid in England itself, and how the British government offered freedom to enslaved African Americans if they would fight for Britain and King George III. The book discusses the many ambiguities involved—some white Loyalists were slaveowners, and some blacks were recruited for the War of Independence. Rough Crossings then follows the fate of the Black Loyalists after the war's end, who, following the British defeat, were sent to Nova Scotia (then still a colony within British North America), where they received a cold welcome, including suffering the first race riots on the continent. Some remained in Nova Scotia, but others returned to Africa to settle in what was to become Sierra Leone. The descendants of those who settled in Freetown are part of the Sierra Leone Creole people, with strong ancestral ties with the United States, the Caribbean, and Canada. Reception The reviews were very favourable. Alex Butterworth wrote in The Guardian: The early chapters of Rough Crossings still bear traces of the television habit - the scene-setting rhetoric, a tendency to over-emphasis [sic] vivid 'moments', precise character thumbnail ... As the book weaves through London, America, Nova Scotia and Africa, though, Schama's technique relaxes, to be laid, most strikingly, at the service of the book's black characters. ... At the end of this immaculately controlled, brave and important work, only the most callous of readers could fail to shed a tear. James Walvin, in his Guardian review, stated: Parts of the story have been well rehearsed by earlier historians, but never like this. One of Schama's great talents is the ability to fit together distinct episodes into a much broader and more telling narrative. He also brings to the story his characteristic flair and historical imagination. The New York Times Brent Staples praised the book as well, describing it as \"a stirringly ambitious reconsideration of the Revolution with the question of slavery set at the very heart of the matter\". Adaptations In 2007, BBC Two aired the drama-documentary Rough Crossings, based on Schama's book. A reviewer stated that the \"success of this endeavour is unfortunately limited as the programme fails to inform its audience which this history should be remembered apart from its perceived strangeness and neglect\". \"The programme's weakness in delivering an effective message is also let down in its use of Schama's pieces to camera and the dramatic reconstructions of the story.\" The two halves of the production, with \"different styles\", \"do not sit well together\". It was released to DVD by BBC Home Entertainment. In 2007, Headlong Theatre produced a stage adaptation, adapted by Caryl Phillips, which toured the UK. The British Theatre Guide review stated, \"This play attempts to take a big book with many strands and meld them into a satisfying three hour play\", but \"is too diffuse to make for a coherent drama\".

{"text": "Haegemonia: Legions of Iron, or Hegemonia: Legions of Iron, is a 3D real-time strategy game developed by Digital Reality for Microsoft Windows, and by Microïds for OS X, iOS, and Android. Storyline Haegemonia takes place in the distant future where humanity has colonized the Solar System and tensions are high between the World Government of Earth and colonial Mars. A summit on Earth's Moon is planned to ease tensions, but the Martian representative's shuttle is destroyed en route by a third, currently unknown, party. The two sides blame each other and this one event sparks off the civil war between the colonists and Earth. The player can side with Captain Jack Garner of Earth to quell the colonial uprising, or join Captain Nilea Cortilliari and the Martian colonists on their campaign for independence. Earth campaign The Earth Campaign of Haegemonia is treated more like a basic training campaign. It teaches the players the basic interface of gameplay and then thrusts them into battle. The first Act the player has to escort a research vessel to the sun. As the players progress through the missions they learn more about how to play the game, gain new units and the ability to build them. The campaign then enters the \"high\" point of the Earth-Mars War. During the last part of the act, they have to prepare for the final assault on Mars. On the last mission, the player is thrust into a tough final battle with Mars, regardless of whether the player is ready or not. Winning the battle will always result in the same situation, a unified Solar System and the forming of the Legions of Iron. After this the acts between Earth and Mars are almost exactly the same. Mars campaign The Mars campaign begins with intercepting trade ships which are supplying Earth's installations. Following this mission are some other missions which contain fights on the outer regions of Sol, between colonies of Mars and Earth. At the end of this episode, the players have to attack Earth, by destroying all units around Earth. These consist of some fighter squads and two (indestructible) military bases. First off, the players kill the fighter squads, then HQ comes in play and sends two kamikaze ships at the military bases. These must be protected by putting the forces between the line of fire from the military bases and the kamikaze ships. Legions of Iron Once the outcome of the war is decided, be it Earth or Mars, humanity unites under the new Unified Government and forms the Legions of Iron, its vanguard of expansion into the unknown, commanded by the player. As the human race expands outward from Sol, mysteries are solved and new ones are created as they encounter new worlds and alien civilizations. The humans encounter a race called the Kariak and become embroiled in a war with them. The player discovers that the Kariak are being manipulated into fighting with humanity by another species named the Darzok. The Kariak then ally with humanity and they jointly defeat the Darzok, foiling their plan to annihilate both races. Gameplay Haegemonia allows the player to create a multi-system empire. At first, only the planets similar to Earth can be colonized. After advanced terraforming and colonization techniques are researched or stolen from enemies, almost any planet can be colonized and, eventually, terraformed into Gaia-class worlds (gas giants are uninhabitable). There are several ways of getting money to fund planetary projects and space construction: tax colonies, steal money from enemies with spies, mine resource-rich asteroids, receive tribute from other races/factions, and other ways (e.g. aid from Earth). Research system is based on research points (RPs) which are allocated at the beginning of each mission. Most of the time, that is the maximum for the mission; however, certain random events may also increase that amount. During the campaign, all researched technologies are transferred from mission to mission, and the player can choose a certain number of ships and heroes to bring along to the next mission. The espionage system is also different from many other games. Spy ships can be constructed in the same manner as other ships, usually no more than 3 may be present at a time. Certain heroes excel at spying and are best placed in those ships. These ships are invisible on sensors and have no sensors of their own (to prevent unfair use as scouts). Instead, spy ships can be assigned mission to be performed on planets, ships, or stations. The higher the level of the spy ship and/or hero is, the more types of missions they may perform (they gain levels by spying). In some cases, a well-trained spy ship may be worth several battleships. Spies can also be used to detect and stop enemy spies. If a spy ship is detected (e.g. spy mission failure, detected by another spy), it becomes visible for a short time to all ships, allowing it to be attacked. Ship behaviors and spy missions can be set using right-click menus. The same is true for subsystem targeting, although it is limited to hull, engines, and weapons. Energy weapons are split up into three groups: cannons (fighters only), turrets (anti-fighter, used on turret corvettes and heavy ships), and blasters (only energy weapon for orbital bombardment, used on blaster corvettes and heavy ships). Weaponry also comes in four distinct forms: Proton: orange, ball-shaped projectile, primarily used by human ships. Proton weapons are fairly accurate and fast-hitting. They have the ability to penetrate shields. Ion: blue-white beam, reminiscent of the Ion Cannons from Homeworld. Ion weapons are mainly used on Kariak ships; they are instant-hitting and have a chance to temporarily disable shields. Quantum: grey-purple cloud. These weapons are slow, compared to proton projectiles, however they have high, area-of-effect damage. Used by Darzoks. Missile: the highest damaging weapons. They are very effective against slow targets and are the ultimate planetary bombardment weapons, possessing a very high kill-off. To counter this, they are ineffective against fighters and very vulnerable to ECM: fully researched, MK-2 ECM systems will cause up to 90% of incoming missiles to veer off-course, though more advanced warheads can resist ECM to some extent. == Music == The music was composed by Ervin Nagy and Tamas Kreiner. Reception Legions of Iron received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Expansion Due to the success of the game, Digital Reality produced an add-on package, The Solon Heritage, which added a few new features, such as a proper skirmish mode, and modding tools. After the destruction of the Armada, a mysterious artifact of Solon origin was discovered, leading to technological advancements and intense military buildup. Because of contract issues (mainly of Wanadoo being sold), The Solon Heritage was not published in the USA. Several changes are presented compared to the original game: New gamemodes: Informant, where one side mainly has spies, while the other military units; Mess-up, where the wormholes move around randomly; Drill, where the only source of income is mining. New ships for all races: diplomatic ships which ferry RPs, money, research, etc. and residential bases which generate additional income. In addition, all races can build Solon ships which has superior firepower, armor, accuracy and firing range, offset by their insanely high upkeep (for example, a cruiser-class Solon Leech costs as much as five Cruisers) and unique vulnerability: destroying the communication center required for building these ships results in all Solon units owned by that player detonating. New race-specific units: Human: dropships wreak major havoc on planets and self-destructing satellites surprising the enemy. Kariak: disintegrator satellites weaken enemy ships while virus ships convert/destroy them. Darzok: kamikaze ships and special satellites whose detection range span through an entire system. Heavily modified units: weaponry of non-fighter military ships have been standardized (corvettes have a single blaster, cruisers have 2 turrets and a blaster while battleships have 3 blasters and one turret), with the result of fighters being more effective (they are smaller and more numerous per group(11)). New spy missions like epidemic, radar sabotage, ecological disaster (reverse terraforming), etc. Over 70 new inventions with several old ones modified. Research can now be done from a nine-item list where each invention is done after the previous one finishes with no manual input required. Deployable ships can be moved and redeployed at will. The Starmap can be rotated. New planetary defense structures are available. Improved AI: trade ships no longer visit enemies' planets because they are no longer ignored by military units. AI players are unpredictable, using every unit to gain the upper hand.

{"text": "Babuyan Claro Volcano, also known as Mount Pangasun, is an active volcano located on Babuyan Island, the northernmost of the Babuyan group of islands in Luzon Strait, north of the main island of Luzon in the Philippines. It is classified as one of the active volcanoes of the country with the last confirmed eruption in 1860. The volcano is politically located in the similarly-named Barangay of Babuyan Claro, in the Municipality of Calayan, Cagayan province, in the Cagayan Valley Region (Region II) of the country. Physical features Babuyan Claro is a stratovolcano with an elevation of and a base diameter of about located in the center of Babuyan Island (also referred to as Babuyan Claro Island). It has four morphologically-fresh volcanic edifices: Mt. Cayonan in the south, Mt. Naydi and Mt. Dionisio in the southeast. Babuyan Claro has two very well-preserved craters in diameter. The Askedna Hot Spring is located at the southern basal slope of Babuyan Claro. It has a temperature range of . The water is slightly acidic and the silica content is relatively high since the spring flows directly from lava flow deposits. The spring water can be classified as near-neutral sodium chloride brine. Eruptions Babuyan Claro has two confirmed historical eruptions: in 1831 and 1860. The eruption on 1913 is listed as uncertain by the Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian Institution while the 1917 eruption is confirmed as an eruption of Smith Volcano. Eruptions on Babuyan Claro is determined as probably strombolian or phreatomagmatic by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. Recent reported activity In July 1993, there were reports of earthquakes and alleged drying up of vegetation at the upper slopes and summit area of the volcano but volcanologists said the earthquakes were of tectonic in origin and there was no significant change in the volcanic activity. In February 2004, there were reports of grayish steam clouds hovering above the summit but volcanologists from PHIVOLCS said the seismic swarm was of tectonic origin and the steaming activity was only wispy to weak.

History In 1643, Bellmore was a farming and fishing town known then as \"Little Neck and \"New Bridge\". Bellmore was settled primarily by Englishmen who crossed Long Island Sound from Connecticut in the middle of the seventeenth century. Bradley Vogel purchased a farm in what is now North Bellmore in 1655. Further south, near the bay, Andres Smith deeded to his son, Jeremiah in 1676. Lee Mattes married Sarah Southard and moved into their new home on Merrick Road in about 1689. Two communities grew out of these beginnings. Smithville (later Smithville South) was named for the many Smith families who lived in the area, and New Bridge, named for the bridge that joined the peninsulas south of Merrick Road. When the railroad was built through the area in 1867 they arbitrarily named their station Bellmore. Development followed as both communities grew towards the railroad and adopted the name Bellmore. By 1920, the Bellmores had a population of 3000 as well as stores along Bedford Avenue. The town was officially named Bellmore in 1900, when the post office was established. The Bellmore Memorial Library, was founded in 1948. It was started in an old schoolhouse. This library has lasted since 1948 until present, keeping it as the main library of Bellmore, New York. In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled against Sam's Stationery and Luncheonette of Bellmore. In Ginsberg v. New York, the Court found that it was well within the state's power to protect minors and that just because the material is not classified as obscene to adults it may still be regulated with minors. Schools The city is home to the annual Mathematical Olympiads for Elementary and Middle Schools, a prestigious school math competition in the United States. General The school districts of Bellmore are the Bellmore School District, North Bellmore School District, and the Bellmore-Merrick Central High School District. The Bellmorites go to school for K-6 in their respective district (North Bellmore or Bellmore) and then go on to the Bellmore-Merrick Central High School District for grades 7-12. This is one of the four central districts of New York. For two years, North Bellmore and Bellmore students are combined in Grand Avenue. After, Bellmore students go to Kennedy, and North Bellmore students to Mepham. However, this may vary depending on zoning. The administrative offices for the Bellmore Public Schools are located in Winthrop Avenue, while the administrative offices for North Bellmore are in Martin Avenue. Brookside School, in North Merrick, is the home of the Bellmore-Merrick Central-High School District's offices, as well as the alternative school. Education The North Bellmore students go to the schools that they are zoned for. However, Bellmore students in the same grade all go to the same school, as each grade level is in one of the three schools and not all. All Bellmore and North Bellmore Students go to Grand Avenue along with a few North Merrick Students who attended Park Avenue Elementary School, and then they split and go to their zoned school in the Central High School District. However, students not zoned for Calhoun may go to that school if they have a special interest in the arts. Students interested in attending Calhoun for the arts must audition. Below are the schools, their grade levels and the town or towns that go to them. An asterisk (*) means that the school is part of the Bellmore Merrick Central High School District.

{"text": "William H. Milliken Jr. (August 19, 1897 – July 4, 1969) was an American politician from Pennsylvania who served as a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district from 1959 to 1965. He served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for Delaware County from 1943 to 1946 and from 1949 to 1950. Early life and education Milliken was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and moved to Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania in 1906. He attended Sharon Hill public schools and graduated from Drexel Institute in Philadelphia. After graduation he worked as a construction foreman and a sales executive for the Whitehall Cement Manufacturing Company. Career He was elected to the Pennsylvania State House of Representatives for Delaware County in a special election in 1943 to serve the remainder of the 1943 term. He was reelected in 1944 and 1948. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1946 and 1950. He served as clerk of courts of Delaware County, Pennsylvania. He was appointed burgess of Sharon Hill to fill an unexpired term on September 14, 1948, and was reelected in 1949, 1953 and 1957 and served until 1959. Milliken was elected as a Republican to the Eighty-sixth, Eighty-seventh and Eighty-eighth Congresses. The 1958 election Milliken was a member of the Delaware County Board of Republican Supervisors, known as the \"War Board\", run by political boss John J. McClure. When Benjamin F. James announced his retirement from Congress in February 1958, there was speculation as to whom the War Board would endorse for his successor. Milliken was among those being considered for the job. When the War Board met on March 21, 1958, at McClure's home, it was reported that those in attendance were: Milliken, state senator G. Robert Watkins; county commissioners Arthur C. Throne and J. Warren Bullen; Walter Weaver of Darby Township; Newtown Township supervisor John Gable; state committeeman Albert H. Swing of Radnor; Fred Duke of Clifton Heights; Roy Blackburn of Haverford Township; and John R. Cramp, county Republican chairman. Milliken was endorsed by the McClure political machine by an undisclosed vote. The primary election was a four-way race for the GOP nomination, with Milliken winning a majority over his rivals. Milliken received 41,553 votes to Edmund Jones, 15,866; Ivan H. \"Cy\" Peterman, an Upper Darby journalist, 11,683; and Upper Darby 10th Ward commissioner Jack F. Robbins, with 11,240. The election between Milliken and Earle degenerated into a bitter race, with the latter accusing the former of having converted county funds to his personal use. Specifically, when Milliken was Clerk of Courts, he had used $5,953 in fees paid to the county for his own use, later paying back all of the funds. James J. Connor, the minority County Commissioner, jumped into the fray, declaring that he would ask his fellow commissioners to file suit against Milliken to recover about $1,400 in estimated interest that these funds would have earned. An indignant Milliken said that his actions were not illegal and had been standard practice, at least by his two predecessors in office, and retaliated by filing a criminal libel suit against Earle. Earle was then arrested and posted a $1,000 bail on October 25, but Milliken failed to appear at the magistrate's hearing at the Springfield Township Building that day. The Democrat was undeterred by the lawsuit and continued his attacks the next day at a rally in Chester, offering to withdraw from the campaign and go to jail if Milliken would answer several pointed questions regarding the missing funds. 1959 to 1960 Milliken was sworn in as Delaware County's representative in Congress on January 3, 1959. After taking office, Milliken was appointed to the House Banking and Currency Committee and introduced several bills in 1959, including one to increase the amount of other income allowed without causing a loss of social security benefits from $1,200 to $1,800. Another bill was to allow the exemption of suburbanites from the Philadelphia wage tax. During the year, he supported President Eisenhower's attempts to hold down federal spending, including numerous vetoes, in 66% of the votes and opposed those efforts 34% of the time. Out of thirty Pennsylvania congressmen, he tied for second place among those supporting economy in government. As a result of these efforts, the budget year ending June 30, 1960, would show a small surplus of $1.2 billion and would be the last budget surplus that would not include the use of the surplus in the trust funds, such as Social Security. Other significant legislation for the year included the approval by the House, 323-89, for Hawaii's admission into the Union, which Milliken supported. During the following year, Milliken supported funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which allowed for court-appointed referees to help register minorities to vote and efforts to increase the minimum wage. For his first term, Milliken proved to be the strongest supporter of the Eisenhower administration in the Pennsylvania delegation, with an 81% score in support and only 18% in opposition. However, on July 1, he deserted his president, along with many other Republicans, in voting to override the veto of a proposed 7.5% pay raise for federal workers. The 1960 election In 1960, Milliken ran for a second term against Democrat Henry Gouley. On October 7, he charged that rumors that the Philadelphia Mint would be closed or moved were false. He charged that Philadelphia Mayor Richardson Dilworth circulated the story \"to scare people in the Philadelphia area during the election campaign\" and that an act of Congress was required to approve such plans. On October 22, Nixon visited Chester, Pennsylvania and spoke to a crowd of about 8,000 at Market Square along with Milliken. Milliken also campaigned on his own, appearing at the Marcus Hook fire company meeting hall on October 27. He attacked JFK and other Democrats who said that the nation's popularity was at an \"all-time low\". During Eisenhower's administration, Milliken countered: \"The U.S. has never been beaten on a single UN vote\" and made a point that U.S. popularity had \"undoubtedly suffered in some areas abroad because of continuing Democrat attempts to downgrade America.\" State Senator Bell also spoke, emphasizing American air power, naval strength, outer space vehicles and hydrogen bombs. The same day, at the Springfield Lions Club meeting at the Deville Diner, both candidates for the Seventh congressional district met. Milliken was introduced by Springfield GOP chairman, Lawrence G. Williams, while Gouley was introduced by Joseph Helwig, the township's Democratic leader. Milliken attacked \"extravagant spending by the Democrats\" in Congress. His opponent, Gouley, issued a rebuttal, stating that under Eisenhower, spending increased 46% in the past eight years and was 68% higher than under the Roosevelt administration, reaching a record total of $579 billion. In Delaware County, with the Democrats having a record 59,500 registered voters and Kennedy's strong appeal, Nixon carried the county by only 135,672 to 124,629. With some ticket-splitting, Milliken's plurality was slightly larger than Nixon's, 136,021 to 120,839. The 1962 mid-term election For the 1962 elections, Democrats had two liberal candidates from Philadelphia heading the statewide ticket in addition to a liberal Democrat in the White House. Republicans went on the attack and raised the issue of the likelihood of annexation of Delaware County by the City of Philadelphia. In April, Milliken spoke in Washington to some 300 members of the Delaware County Women's Republican Club, declaring that if Dilworth was elected \"...we will have become a part of Philadelphia before his term as governor is up.\" He further elaborated that if the Democrats win, it \"will be the beginning of the end of home rule\" for the county and the election will be a \"fight for survival for Delaware County\". He was joined by William Scranton, who strongly supported Milliken's reelection, emphasizing that the latter had been named to the House appropriations committee at a time when fiscal conservatism was important. James E. Van Zandt joined in, predicting a \"voters' rebellion\" that will spell victory for the GOP. By the fall, the campaign rhetoric heated up and became even more exaggerated. On September 24, at another Women's Republican Club function at the Alpine Inn in Springfield, Scranton's solution to crime in Philadelphia was evidently to blame Dilworth for a \"reign of terror\" in the city \"that stops women and children ... from walking even one block to go to the store.\" Adding further to the fear tactics, Congressman Van Zandt charged that Clark was \"soft on Communism\". Milliken added the only sensible point: \"If this country continues spending as it is doing, it will spend itself into bankruptcy.\" Meanwhile, the Democratic candidate for Congress, Chester attorney John A. Reilly, went on the attack, accusing Milliken of \"double talk\" and expecting to win due to the \"complacency of Delaware County voters. I feel they are entitled to learn that Milliken has done nothing constructive in Washington and that he is no more than a puppet for his Chester bosses.\" He also decried Milliken's raising of \"phony issues such as annexation\". On October 4, the Upper Darby GOP committee issued a statement: \"If the voters of Upper Darby Township want to stop Philadelphia at 63rd Street, they can do so by voting a straight Republican ticket this fall.\" Meanwhile, in response to Reilly's call for debates, Milliken said that his busy schedule made it impossible to debate. Reilly, in turn, said that the incumbent congressman was \"full of phony excuses\" and \"afraid of the voters\". Milliken won easily with 136,955 votes to Reilly's 88,482. War Board Revolt After the 1963 General Election in Delaware County, a power struggle broke out among members of the Republican ruling circles. Milliken had aligned himself with Sam Dickey from Upper Darby against McClure in an attempt to take over the War Board. McClure had attempted to appoint Upper Darby Township Commissioner George Hill, a former Dickey rival, to the War Board, rather than a representative chosen by Dickey. The Upper Darby Board of Commissioners, in their other capacity as GOP ward leaders, voted to nominate Dickey himself to the War Board. By early 1964, the War Board split had attracted four other Republican candidates for Milliken's seat: Harold Ervin of Media; John G. Pew, replacing Swing on the War Board; attorney Stephen McEwen of Upper Darby; and former county commissioner Watkins. Matters came to a head on February 7, when the War Board endorsed Watkins over Milliken, citing the latter's poor health as the reason for rejection. Milliken received only one vote, presumably his own, in the War Board polling. Later that month, the Collingdale Republican leaders followed the lead of Glenolden, Darby, Prospect Park and Tinicum, in dumping Milliken as its representative on the War Board. There was some measure of suspense as Milliken pondered another race, this time as an independent, but on February 18, he issued a terse statement: \"After consideration, I have decided not to be a candidate for reelection to the U.S. Congress.\" Milliken served out the last year of his term, until January 3, 1965, but would surface again as a candidate in 1966, unsuccessfully bucking his party's leadership. He died in Ridley Park on July 4, 1969, and is interred at Arlington Cemetery in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania.

He competed in Grand Prix motorcycle racing between 1966 and 1975, most prominently as a member of the Yamaha factory racing team where he was a two-time 125cc World Champion. Andersson was notable for being the only Swedish rider to win an FIM road racing world championship. Motorcycle racing career Born in Landvetter, Sweden, Andersson rode in his first national championship races at the age of 19 in Sweden and Denmark on a Monark in the 250 cc class. He then rode a 250 cc Bultaco for the 1962 season. He proved himself to be a capable competitor. After winning the 250cc Swedish national championship in 1965, Andersson moved up to the world championships competing with Husqvarna bikes that he modified himself. He bought a Yamaha 250 cc production racer and began posting solid results. In 1969 he finished second in the 250 championship after a season-long battle with Santiago Herrero and eventual champion Kel Carruthers. These impressive results earned him a place on the Yamaha factory 250 cc racing team as Rod Gould's teammate for the 1970 season, in which he finished third. Yamaha chose Andersson to help develop their TA125 racebike for the 1971 season. He went on to finish second in the 1972 on the water-cooled development model designated YZ623C, and claim the 1973 125cc World Championship. In 1974, he successfully defended his title by winning five races along with two second-place finishes. Andersson retired after finishing 3rd in the 1975 season and took a position at Yamaha Europe's Developing and Constructing Department. Among other projects, Andersson had an important role in developing the three-cylinder 350 cc bike that Takazumi Katayama rode to win the 350cc road racing world championship in 1977. Andersson continued racing in his later years just for fun at an amateur level in Sweden, but did so well that he won the Supermono National Championship in 1995 at the age of 53. He was a successful member of Ferry Brouwer's Dutch Yamaha Classic Racing Team. He often participated in classic exhibition races all over Europe. Andersson sometimes served as expert Road Racing commentator for Swedish Eurosport. Andersson died in August 2006 in Landvetter at the age of 64.

{"text": "The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) is the professional body responsible for the specialties of clinical oncology and clinical radiology throughout the United Kingdom. Its role is to advance the science and practice of radiology and oncology, further public education, and set appropriate professional standards of practice. The college sets and monitors the educational curriculum for those training to enter the profession, and administers the Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists exams. It is a registered charity in the United Kingdom (no. 211540). The RCR has 2 faculties, representing Clinical Oncology and Clinical Radiology. It publishes two academic journals, Clinical Oncology and Clinical Radiology. The RCR has been based at 63 Lincoln's Inn Fields in London since July 2013. History A series of bodies has represented practitioners of radiological medicine in the UK, starting in 1897 with the foundation of the Roentgen Society (named for the physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen). Subsequently, the British Association of Radiologists was founded in 1934. In 1935, The Society of Radiotherapists of Great Britain and Ireland was set up for doctors specialising in the treatment of cancers using X-rays and radium. The latter two bodies amalgamated in 1939 to form the Faculty of Radiologists, which was granted a Royal Charter in 1953. In 1975, a Supplemental Charter was granted, and the Faculty became the Royal College of Radiologists. In 1950, the first issue of the Clinical Radiology Journal was published by the Faculty of Radiologists. The first issue of Clinical Oncology was published in September 1989. In May 2021, the RCR launched the first national radiotherapy consent forms to help standardise and strengthen the informed consent process for adult cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Standardised consent forms with tailored information regarding radiotherapy for different tumour sites were released, and digital versions developed in collaboration with digital consent company Concentric Health. Welsh language versions of the consent forms were published in June 2022. Fellowship of Royal College of Radiologist Examinations Candidates are examined against the Specialty Training Curriculum for Clinical Radiology. The specialty trainees are expected to complete their First FRCR examination before progressing to ST2.

{"text": "The Triplets (; ; ) are three fictional characters (Anna, Teresa and Helena) created by Spanish illustrator Roser Capdevila. The Triplets were created in 1983, based on Capdevila's own daughters, three actual triplets born in 1969. The stories were immediately successful and began publishing in many countries. In 1985 a new character, the \"Bored Witch\" (La Bruixa Avorrida) was added to the plots to form a collection of classical stories, \"The Triplets and (...)\". In 1994, television producer Cromosoma and the Catalan TV corporation Televisió de Catalunya adapted the stories to make an animated series based on the books. It became very successful and profitable and led to the production of a second series with the Bored Witch as the main character, together with France 3, Canal J and Storimages. By 2004, The Triplets series consisted of 104 episodes, while The Bored Witch reached 52. They have been translated to 35 different languages and have been shown in 158 countries or territories. A spin-off series was also made, titled The Baby Triplets. In October 2020, it was announced that the series will receive a reboot that will focus 20 years after the first one ended. Plot The plots of the triplet sisters follow a definite pattern. Sometimes they play some prank or manage to annoy the Bored Witch, and, to punish them, she sends them into a classic tale, legend, or children's or adult's (such as Frankenstein or The Phantom of the Opera) literary work. The main structure of the classic remains, but some twists (often hilarious anachronisms such as showing The forty thieves getting distracted from robbing a house by a camel race on TV or Dr. Frankenstein as a veterinarian) are introduced to favor each plot and define the sisters' personalities. Characters Teresa (Tessa in the English dub) - She wears the pink ribbon. She is the most adventurous triplet and comes up with the most ambitious ideas, but she's not necessarily the leader. Anna (Annie in the English dub) - She wears the blue ribbon. She's laid-back and more peaceful than her sisters. She's also quite curious. Anna tends to be a bit romantic at times. Helena (Nellie in the English dub) - She wears the green ribbon. She has the sweetest demeanor of the triplets. She also has a love for food and sweets, which sometimes leads to trouble. The Bored Witch - She is an overweight witch who is always bored, despite having great magical powers. She serves as a kind of unofficial day sitter for the triplets, but when they start acting disorderly, she uses her magic to send the girls into stories. No matter what, she never uses magic to directly hinder the girls in their adventures, although tends to join forces with every story's antagonist. Despite her role of antagonist, she is not an evil character and always keeps her word to return the girls to their land. Episodes The Triplets find themselves involved in a different classic story in each chapter.

{"text": "Åsta Gudbrandsdatter (c. 975/980 – c. 1020/1030) was the mother of two Norwegian kings, King Olaf II of Norway and King Harald III of Norway. The primary source for the life of Åsta is Snorri Sturluson's saga Heimskringla, a 13th-century collection of tales about the lives of the Norwegian kings. In the chronicle, Åsta is described as \"generous and high-minded\" and as a keen political player and guiding influence on her royal husbands and children. Her parents were Gudbrand Kula and Ulfhild. Wife of Harald Grenske Åsta Gudbrandsdatter first appears in Snorri's 'Saga of King Olaf Tryggvason' as the wife of Harald Grenske (Grenski), ruler of Vestfold. In the summer of 994, although already married to Åsta, Harald traveled to the Baltic and proposed marriage to his foster-sister Sigrid. He had learned that her landholdings in Sweden were no less extensive than his own in Norway, and promised to abandon Åsta, who although \"good and clever\" was not as well-born as he was. Sigrid refused, objecting that Harald should feel fortunate in his existing marriage and that Åsta was carrying Harald's child. When she rode off, Harald pursued her back to her estate. That evening, Sigrid hosted a lavish feast at which Harald and his companions became drunk. Under cover of darkness, she ordered her armed men to set fire to the hall in which Harald slept, and he was killed; those of his companions who escaped the flames were put to the sword. Following this episode, Sigrid was called Storråda, 'the Haughty.' On learning of her husband's death, Åsta was outraged both by Harald's infidelity and his murder. She returned immediately to the home of her father Gudbrand Kula in Oppland, where later that year she gave birth to a son, whom she named Olaf. He would later be renowned as St. Olaf, King of Norway from 1015 to 1028. Marriage to Sigurd Syr and Baptism Soon after Harald Grenske's death, Åsta married Sigurd Syr, king of Ringerike, and brought the child Olaf with her to be raised in the home of his stepfather. When King Olaf Tryggvason of Norway arrived in 998 to convert the populace of Ringerike to Christianity, Sigurd, Åsta, and Olaf were all baptized, with the king himself acting as Olaf's godfather. According to the sagas, Åsta and Sigurd Syr were good and noble rulers and had the following children together: Guttorm Gunnhild - married Ketil Kalv of Ringnes in Stange Halfdan Ingerid - married Nevstein, mother of Tore, foster-father of King Magnus Barefoot Harald III 'Hardrada'- King of Norway from 1047 to 1066, sometimes called 'the last great Viking' Influence In 1007, Åsta arranged Olaf's first military expedition by ordering her steward Hrane to take the then-twelve-year-old Olaf on board a warship as commander. According to Heimskringla, it was custom that a captain of noble descent automatically be afforded the rank 'King'; Åsta thus strategically secured a title for her son although he did not yet have any lands or holdings. When Olaf returned home in 1014 as an accomplished leader, Åsta ordered her household to receive him in the manner of a great king. When Sigurd Syr heard this, knowing Olaf's ambitions, he questioned whether Åsta could lead her son \"out of this business with the same splendour she was leading him into it.\" Olaf took his mother into military counsel along with Sigurd and Hrane. When he shared his intention to declare himself sole ruler of Norway, Åsta threw her support behind her son: \"For my part, my son, I am rejoiced at thy arrival, but much more at thy advancing thy honour. I will spare nothing for that purpose that stands in my power, although it be but little help that can be expected from me. But if a choice could be made, I would rather that thou shouldst be the supreme king of Norway, even if thou shouldst not sit longer in thy kingdom than Olaf Tryggvason did, than that thou shouldst not be a greater king than Sigurd Syr is, and die the death of old age.\" Sigurd Syr lent military support to Olaf in his campaigns and on the occasion of her son's 1018 victory over the Oppland kings, Åsta held a great feast of victory. Åsta was also the mother of King Harald III, who was fifteen years old when his brother Olaf died at the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030. Harald ruled Norway from 1046 until his death in 1066 at the Battle of Stamford Bridge; his famous defeat by the forces of England's King Harold Godwinson has traditionally been considered the end of the Viking Age.

{"text": "The Outer Barrier, also known as the Long Island and New York City barrier islands, refers to the string of barrier islands that divide the lagoons south of Long Island, New York from the Atlantic Ocean. These islands include Long Beach Barrier Island, Barnum Island, Jones Beach Island, Fire Island and Westhampton Island. The outer barrier extends along the South Shore of Long Island, from the Rockaway Peninsula in New York City to the east end of Shinnecock Bay in Suffolk County. The lagoons enclosed by the barrier islands are Jamaica Bay, Brosewere Bay, Hewlett Bay, Reynolds Channel, Middle Bay, East Bay, South Oyster Bay, Great South Bay, and arms of the Great South Bay that have their own geographic names: Great Cove, Nicoll Bay, Patchogue Bay, Bellport Bay, Narrow Bay, Moriches Bay, Quantuck Bay, Tiana Bay, and Shinnecock Bay. East Rockaway Inlet, Jones Inlet, Fire Island Inlet, Old Inlet, Moriches Inlet, and Shinnecock Inlet pierce the barrier, forming the individual sandy islands. The resort communities of Atlantic Beach, Long Beach, and Westhampton Beach; the Fire Island National Seashore, Robert Moses State Park, Jones Beach State Park, and other recreational areas are found there. The low-lying islands are subject to wave erosion, and, during storms, they are sometimes inundated and cut through. The islands New York City islands Coney Island, Plumb Beach, Barren Island, several smaller islands in Jamaica Bay, and parts of what is now the Rockaway peninsula formerly comprised the westernmost Outer Barrier islands. Of these, Coney Island was the westernmost island. Most of these islands were either connected to mainland Long Island or combined with each other in the early 20th century. Long Beach Barrier Island Long Beach Barrier Island lies off the south shore of Long Island. The island is shared by the hamlet of Atlantic Beach to the west, the city of Long Beach and the hamlet of Lido Beach in the central part of the island, and the hamlet of Point Lookout at the eastern end of the island. (The three hamlets — Atlantic Beach, Lido Beach, and Point Lookout — are part of the town of Hempstead, New York.) Within its section of the barrier island, the city of Long Beach spans the entire north-south width of the island, fronting on both Reynolds Channel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south. A drawbridge, the Long Beach Bridge, connects it to Island Park, a small island which lies between Long Beach and the mainland of Long Island. To the west, the Atlantic Beach Bridge connects the island to Lawrence on Long Island. The Loop Parkway, located to the east where Lido Beach and Point Lookout border one another, connects the island to Jones Beach. Jones Beach Island Jones Beach Island is a barrier island off the southern coast of Long Island in the U.S. state of New York. It is named for the father of historian Thomas Jones. It is sometimes referred to as Oak Beach Island, and the former home of the infamous Oak Beach Inn. It is separated from Long Island by Great South Bay. The island straddles the county line between Nassau and Suffolk counties and includes the census-designated places of Gilgo, Oak Beach, and Captree. The southern side of the island is known for its beaches that face the open Atlantic Ocean. Jones Beach State Park, on the western tip of the island is a summer recreational destination for the New York City area. It is accessible from Long Island on its western end by the Meadowbrook Parkway to Merrick, New York, the Loop Parkway to Long Beach, New York and the Wantagh Parkway to Wantagh, New York. Its eastern end is linked to Babylon, New York as well as to Fire Island, New York by the Robert Moses Causeway via the Great South Bay Bridge and the State Boat Channel Bridge. The Ocean Parkway connects all three causeways and runs the length of the island, while The Fire Island Inlet Bridge continues on the Robert Moses Causeway finding its way to the New York's Fire Island on the Atlantic Ocean. Fire Island Fire Island is a barrier island, approximately 31 miles (50 km) long and varying between approximately 0.1 mile (160 m) to 0.25 mile (400 m) wide. Fire Island passes through southern Suffolk County, New York, and is southeast of Long Island separated from the main land by the Great South Bay in the U.S. state of New York, running approximately SW to NE. The land area is 8.687 sq. mi. (22.5 km2), and a permanent population of 491 people was reported as of the 2000 census. (There are hundreds of thousands of summertime residents, groupers and daytrippers.) The island is composed of three communities, as defined by the Census Bureau. The largest of these is Fire Island (CDP), which is unincorporated and stretches through the southern portion of the towns of Babylon, Islip, and Brookhaven. There are several ocean front communities such as, Davis Park and Watch Hill that are on the eastern side of the Great south bay. Fire Island has a variety of ocean front communities that can be reached by private boat, or seasonal ferry service from Long Island's mainland. Fire Island has a 2000 census population of 310 inhabitants. There are also two villages in the Islip section of the island, Saltaire (pop. 43) and Ocean Beach (pop. 138). In addition, a part of Fire Island CDP is not even on the island, but on a separate island adjacent to West Hampton Dunes. Fire Island Inlet is an inlet on the south shore of Long Island, New York. It connects the Great South Bay with the Atlantic Ocean, passing between Robert Moses State Park (the western end of Fire Island) on the south and Oak Beach and Captree State Park (the eastern end of Jones Island) on the north. The stated land area and population figures result when this section is subtracted out. The inlet is directly south of West Islip, the nearest town on the main part of Long Island. The inlet has evolved over the years due to natural processes, especially longshore drift. Jones Island and Fire Island at one time were connected. The Fire Island Light was at the mouth of the inlet when built in 1858, but is now six miles east of the inlet. Westhampton Island Westhampton Island is the easternmost outer barrier island in the Town of Southampton. The barrier island was part of Fire Island until a nor'easter in 1931 created Moriches Inlet and made Fire Island a proper island. In 1938, Shinnecock Inlet created this fourth barrier island. Cupsogue Beach County Park is located on the western end of the island. Moriches Inlet is an inlet connecting Moriches Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. The inlet created a geographic oddity whereby the Town of Brookhaven actually has jurisdiction on land immediately west of the village of West Hampton Dunes although Brookhaven land access to it involves a nearly 20 mile drive through Southampton. Shinnecock Inlet is the easternmost of five major inlets connecting bays to the Atlantic Ocean through the narrow 100-mile-long barrier islands that stretch from New York City to Southampton, New York on the south shore of Long Island. The inlet was formed by the Great Hurricane of 1938 which killed several people when it permanently broke through the island in Hampton Bays, New York. The inlet is almost directly lined up with the Shinnecock Canal between Shinnecock Bay and the Peconic Bay and saves miles for boaters going to the open Atlantic. Consequently, management has been geared to keep the inlet dredged and open. However, maintenance of the inlet has been controversial on grounds that it causes beach erosion on Fire Island.

{"text": "The judiciaries of the United Kingdom are the separate judiciaries of the three legal systems in England and Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. The judges of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, Employment Tribunals, Employment Appeal Tribunal and the UK tribunals system do have a United Kingdom–wide jurisdiction but judgments only apply directly to the jurisdiction from which a case originates as the same case points and principles do not inevitably apply in the other jurisdictions. In employment law, employment tribunals and the Employment Appeal Tribunal have jurisdiction in the whole of Great Britain (i.e., not in Northern Ireland). There have been multiple calls from both Welsh academics and politicians however for a Wales criminal justice system. Justices of the Supreme Court The judges of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom are known as Justices of the Supreme Court, and they are also Privy Counsellors. Justices of the Supreme Court are granted the courtesy title Lord or Lady for life. The Supreme Court is a relatively new Court being established in October 2009 following the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. Formerly, the Highest Court of Appeal in the United Kingdom was the House of Lords Appellate Committee made up of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, also known as Law Lords, which with other Lord Justices now form the Supreme Court. It also took over devolution cases from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Such Law Lords were allowed to sit in the House of Lords and were members for life. The Supreme Court serves as the highest court of appeal for all cases in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland, but only for civil cases in Scotland. The High Court of Justiciary remains the court of last resort in Scotland for criminal cases. The Supreme Court is headed by the President and Deputy President of the Supreme Court and is composed of a further ten Justices of the Supreme Court. The Justices do not wear any gowns or wigs in court, but on ceremonial occasions they wear black damask gowns with gold lace without a wig. Tribunal Judiciary The UK tribunal system is part of the national system of administrative justice with tribunals classed as non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs). Though it has grown up on an ad hoc basis since the beginning of the twentieth century, from 2007 reforms were put in place to build a unified system with recognised judicial authority, routes of appeal and regulatory supervision, and recognised legally qualified members of tribunals as members of the judiciary who are guaranteed continued judicial independence.

{"text": "William Blamire Young (9 August 1862 – 14 January 1935), commonly known as Blamire Young, was an English/Australian artist who painted primarily in watercolour. Biography Early life Young was born at Londesborough, Yorkshire, the second son of a family of 12. His father, Colonel Young, came of prosperous yeoman stock. Blamire Young was educated at the Forest School, Walthamstow, where he received a classical training, and going on to Cambridge University specialised in mathematics. That he completed his course with no better than third-class honours was no doubt partly caused by his discovery of the print collection in the Fitzwilliam Museum, and his association with the Cambridge Fine Art Society. It had been intended that he should become a clergyman, but Young felt that he had no vocation for that work and obtained the position of mathematical master at Katoomba College, Katoomba, New South Wales, which had been founded by John Walter Fletcher in 1884. Young remained at the school for eight years. In his spare time he practised painting, and meeting Phil May received some instruction from him in painting in oil. Artistic work In 1893, he returned to England and after working for a few months under Hubert von Herkomer, became associated with James Pryde and William Nicholson in poster work. In 1895 Young returned to Australia and with the Lindsay brothers and Harry Weston did some excellent posters. But the field was limited and many years of poverty followed, during which a certain amount of writing was done for the press. He began exhibiting at the Victorian Artists' Society, but sales were few and the one-man show was then unknown. During his visit to England he had married Mabel Sawyer, an expert wood-carver, and while the lean period lasted Mrs Young helped to keep the house going by executing commissions for Melbourne architects. It was not until 1911 that the appreciation of Young's art really began to be shown. In that year he held an exhibition at Melbourne of small pictures, some of which had similar qualities to the Japanese coloured wood-cuts of the eighteenth century. Sales were good, partly because the prices were low, and the artist was sufficiently encouraged to hold an exhibition at Adelaide. This was both an artistic and a financial success, other shows followed in Melbourne and Sydney, and at last, in his fiftieth year, Young's reputation as an artist was established. In 1911 he was commissioned by the Postmaster-General of Australia, C E Frazer, to produce new designs for the first Commonwealth of Australia stamps. He submitted the designs in January 1912. Three types of printed essays for the Kangaroo and Map stamps are known. This design was first issued on 2 January 1913 and continued to be in use till 1935 concurrently with other stamps. The design was also used on postal stationery envelopes, letter cards, registration envelopes and newspaper wrappers. Later years In 1912 he sailed for Europe and after a stay in Spain settled in England. Eighteen months later in August 1914 his first show, opened at the Bailey Galleries. All the arrangements had been made and the pictures hung when war broke out. Young had been a good marksman in his youth, and for three years worked as an instructor in musketry and machine-gunnery. Immediately after the war he took up his painting again and exhibited at the Academy and the Royal Society of British Artists. Back in Australia in 1923 Young established himself at Montrose in the hills about 20 miles east of Melbourne. He acted as art critic for The Herald and held occasional one-man shows. His position was now secure, and he was recognised everywhere as one of the leading artists in water-colour in Australia. He died at Montrose and was survived by his wife and two daughters. In addition to his newspaper writings he published a one-act play The Children's Bread in 1912, and in 1923 The Proverbs of Goya, an interesting attempt to disclose the inner meaning of Goya's series of etchings known as Los disparates. Another one-act play, Art for Arts Sake, was produced at the Melbourne Repertory Theatre in 1911. Legacy In 1976 he was honoured on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post for his work as designer of the first Australian postage stamp.

{"text": "KUOK-CA, VHF analog channel 11, was a low-powered television station licensed to Norman, Oklahoma, United States. The station was owned by Equity Broadcasting. History The station first signed on the air in 1997 as KDSA-LP, carrying programming from The Worship Network, which had already broadcast on KMNZ (channel 62, now KOPX-TV) before and after that station became the market's Pax TV (now Ion Television) owned-and-operated station. In 2000, KDSA affiliated with religious broadcaster Daystar. After the affiliation switch to Univision was announced, Daystar programming was moved to upstart O&O station KOCM (channel 46) in December 2003. In the summer of 2004, the station requested to the Federal Communications Commission to have its call letters changed to KUOK-CA, which was made official that fall. The station became a Univision affiliate on May 8, 2004, as part of a six-station bi-state network then known as \"Univision Arkansas-Oklahoma\" which also included KUOK (channel 36, to which KUOK-CA served as a translator) and the three other low-power stations that also Equity acquired to become its translators (K69EK (channel 69, later KWDW-LP, KUOK-LP, KOCY-LP, and now KOCY-LD on channel 48), KCHM-LP (channel 36, now KUOK-CD), and Sulphur-based KOKT-LP (channel 20)), originally relayed Univision programming across Oklahoma via a direct simulcast from then-sister station KLRA-LP (now KKYK-CD) in Little Rock, Arkansas. In March 2005, KUOK – though still programmed via satellite from Equity's headquarters in Little Rock – discontinued the KLRA-LP simulcast, with it and its translators began carrying advertising for businesses within the Oklahoma City market and separate station promotions. KUOK-CA broke off from the Univision simulcast on May 30, 2007, when the station switched to LAT TV as part of a new affiliation deal between the network and Equity.

{"text": "Adelaide Festival Centre, Australia's first capital city multi-purpose arts centre and the home of South Australia's performing arts, was built in the 1970s, designed by Hassell Architects. Located on Kaurna Yarta, the Festival Theatre opened in June 1973 with the rest of the centre following soon after. The complex includes Festival Theatre, Dunstan Playhouse (formerly The Playhouse and Optima Playhouse), Space Theatre (formerly The Space) and several gallery and function spaces. Located approximately north of the corner of North Terrace and King William Road, lying near the banks of the River Torrens and adjacent to Elder Park, it is distinguished by its two white geometric dome roofs, and lies on a 45-degree angle to the city's grid. Adelaide Festival Centre hosts Adelaide Festival and presents major festivals across the year including Adelaide Cabaret Festival, OzAsia Festival, DreamBIG Children's Festival, Adelaide Guitar Festival and OUR MOB. It is also home to Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, State Opera South Australia, Australian Dance Theatre, State Theatre Company South Australia, The Australian Ballet, Brink and Windmill Theatre Co. The Festival Centre is managed by a statutory corporation, the Adelaide Festival Centre Trust, which is responsible for encouraging and facilitating artistic, cultural and performing arts activities, as well as maintaining and improving the building and facilities of the Adelaide Festival Centre complex and Her Majesty's Theatre. The Festival Centre was erected on the site of the Adelaide City Baths, which had been there for over a century. the site (external to the venues) is undergoing major redevelopment, started in 2016, but the theatre spaces have remained open. The car park has been completed. The redevelopment was completed in February 2022. History and construction Background In the 1960s, the Adelaide Festival of the Arts started to outgrow the city's existing venues, and there was a push to build a \"Festival Hall\". The Adelaide Festival Theatre Act 1964 provided for the erection of the Festival Theatre building. The originally proposed site was the Carclew building in North Adelaide, which had been purchased from the Bonython family by the Adelaide City Council for the purposes of building a Festival Hall. Liberal state Premier Steele Hall lobbied the Federal Government for tax concessions for a public appeal for the Festival Hall, which was initially unsuccessful, until Prime Minister John Gorton offered Hall either tax concessions or . Hall accepted the money. While on a trip to London, Steele Hall visited the Royal Festival Hall on the banks of the River Thames and decided that the banks of the River Torrens was the ideal choice for the site of the Adelaide Festival of the Arts and the cultural heart of the city. During this time, the state government changed hands, but the drive for a new centre continued with fervour. When Don Dunstan became Premier he expanded the idea into a \"Festival Centre\", incorporating multiple smaller venues. The Lord Mayor of Adelaide, Robert Porter, supported by Dunstan, launched a public appeal to raise funds to build the Festival Centre and establish Adelaide as a significant city in the art world. The appeal raised its target within a week, and was soon over-subscribed; the surplus was set aside to create a collection of artworks to grace the new building. The building was designed by Hassell, McConnell and Partners for the Adelaide City Council and the Adelaide Festival Centre Trust, and has been \"hailed as a major step forward in modern architecture in South Australia\". It was designed \"from the inside out\" and is particularly associated with the architect John Morphett and Colin Hassell. Prior to designing the buildings, Hassell led a team which included Morphett to the United States and Europe to undertake a study of theatre designs. The Adelaide City Baths, which had stood on the site since their creation in 1861 and upgraded several times since, including the addition of an Olympic-sized swimming pool in 1940, were demolished in 1969 to make way for the new centre. Construction Adelaide Festival Centre, Australia's first multi-purpose arts centre, was built in three parts, from April 1970 to 1980. The main building, the Festival Theatre, was completed in 1973, within its budget of . On 2 June 1973 the Festival Theatre was officially opened by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam at a gala performance of Act Two, Scene 1 of Beethoven's opera Fidelio and Choral Symphony. The construction of the Playhouse (now Dunstan Playhouse), Space Theatre and Amphitheatre followed. The whole complex was completed for . (By comparison, the Sydney Opera House, completed in 1973, cost .) Outdoor areas Outdoor sculptures graced the outdoor spaces, including the prominent stainless steel Tetrahedra, also known as Environmental Sculpture and Tetrahedrons, by Bert Flugelman (whose Mall's Balls is perhaps his better known work). South of complex, the Festival Plaza, initially known as the Southern Plaza was completed in March 1977, comprising an environmental sculpture by highly regarded West German artist Otto Hajek, which he called Adelaide Urban Iconography. (In the Festival Centre archives it is variously named Shorthand Adelaide, City Iconograph, and City Iconography, and government records give the title City Sign Sculpture Garden. It has also been referred to as \"Hajek's Plaza\", and was believed to be the largest artwork in Australia. Given the brief of camouflaging the new air-conditioning vent from the carpark below that would rise from the concrete surface of the plaza, Hajek, arguing that the \"real job\" of sculpture was social, created a plan that integrated sculpture with architecture, creating a social space encompassing the whole Southern Plaza. His plan consisted of \"colourful, geometric painted surfaces and cement forms\", and it was intended to include a fountain and other water features, extensive planting of vegetation, lighting and provision for sound, which would encourage people to interact with the \"concrete garden\". After its opening on 22 March 1977, the plaza stirred debate and opinions were mixed, but its designs were seen to \"consciously exemplify the new practices and relations embodied in the concept of environmental art\". Labelled as empty and ugly by some, it was nonetheless an artwork of its times. In 1977 it was awarded a \"brickbat\" by the Civic Trust, but Australia Post honoured the sculpture in 1986 by issuing a commemorative stamp for South Australia’s sesquicentenary. Hajek's wife, artist and poet Katja Hajek, wrote in 2001 that the plaza \"is well-known in the world of art and became acknowledged as an artistically outstanding creation of the last quarter of the 20th century\". In the decades following, its painted surfaces, fountains and vegetation were not well-maintained, there were some problems with its concrete decking, it was not used for events, and, crucially, it did not attract incidental foot traffic to interact with its forms. In 1987, the fountain, unused for the prior three years owing to a leak, was demolished as part of a upgrade of the plaza. 21st century redevelopment In 2002–3, the area around Adelaide Festival Centre was redeveloped substantially. The Festival Plaza was redesigned, including opening the underground roadway to the sky. Although a pedestrian suspension bridge was built on its west side, the Plaza was essentially isolated as a result of this redevelopment. In 2013, the Government of South Australia announced that the Plaza would be redeveloped, with Hajek's work decommissioned and replaced. The removal of such a significant public work of art was seen as vandalism by some commentators, including Hajek's wife. However, not everyone in the world of art and architecture or the general public mourned its passing. From 2016 the Festival Plaza has been undergoing a redevelopment, as part of the major redevelopment of the Riverbank Precinct. The new public plaza, known as the Public Realm, was expected to be completed by 2020, while the office buildings and retail spaces are scheduled to be finished by 2022. The architects of the original complex, Hassell, remain as architectural consultants for the project, in collaboration with ARM Architecture and landscape architects Taylor Cullity Lethlean for the outdoor spaces. Changes to the design of the Public Realm submitted for approval in April 2020 were expected to push back the completion date to 2023, and there is limited access to the venues and no access to the plaza area. 2018 tram extension A short branch from the Glenelg tram line to the Festival Centre was opened in October 2018. Governance In 1971 the Adelaide Festival Centre Trust was established as a statutory authority by the Adelaide Festival Centre Trust Act 1971, reporting to the Minister for the Arts. From about 1996 until late 2018, Arts SA (later Arts South Australia) had responsibility for this and several other statutory bodies such as the South Australian Museum and the Art Gallery of South Australia. Arts SA leased Her Majesty's Theatre and the Festival Centre to the Trust, which was responsible for \"encouraging and facilitating artistic, cultural and performing arts activities throughout the State\" and managing and maintaining the theatres. In July 2017, the Trust bought Her Majesty's Theatre from Arts South Australia for . It also borrowed from the South Australian Government Financing Authority for a maximum term of 10 years to fund Her Majesty’s Theatre redevelopment. From late 2018, the functions previously held by Arts SA were transferred to direct oversight by the Department of the Premier and Cabinet, Arts and Culture section. Venues Adelaide Festival Centre houses several theatres and galleries, as well as function spaces and the administrative hub of the Festival Centre. Festival Theatre is the largest proscenium arch theatre in Adelaide, seating close to 2000 people. It was designed as both a lyric theatre and concert hall, and is used not only for theatrical productions and large concerts, but also for graduation ceremonies, seminars and many other community functions. Its huge backstage area makes the stage area one of the largest in the southern hemisphere. It also houses the Silver Jubilee Organ, a \"hovering\" pipe organ built and donated to mark the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. Dunstan Playhouse, initially known as The Playhouse, and in 1999–2000 the Optima Playhouse, and then renamed after Don Dunstan. It is located in the Drama Centre behind the main building, is a more intimate venue, seating 620 people on two levels. The State Theatre Company has been based here since 1974, and uses the theatre, the rehearsal rooms and the extensive production workshop also housed in this second building. Space Theatre is a versatile studio theatre, sharing the Drama Centre building with the Dunstan. It has no traditional stage or fixed seating, meaning its configuration is completely flexible. It can be turned into a theatre in the round, a corner stage setting, or a cabaret venue. The Space seats anywhere from 200 to 350 people, depending on the configuration. Her Majesty's Theatre is 1500-seat theatre located on Grote Street. First opened in 1913, the theatre underwent extensive rebuilding from 2018 to 2020 to become a world-class venue. Artspace Gallery is a gallery exhibition space situated in the second building above the Dunstan Playhouse. The Terrace, formerly called the Amphitheatre, is an outdoor space overlooking Elder Park and the River Torrens. Artspace Gallery and QBE Galleries are further exhibition spaces. Associated companies and events Adelaide Festival Centre is home to South Australia's leading professional performance companies, including Adelaide Symphony Orchestra, State Opera South Australia, Australian Dance Theatre, State Theatre Company of South Australia, Brink Productions and Windmill Theatre Co.

{"text": "The English Missal (sometimes referred to as the Knott Missal) is a translation of the Roman Missal used by some Anglo-Catholic parish churches. After its publication by W. Knott & Son Limited in 1912, The English Missal was rapidly endorsed by the growing Ritualist movement of Anglo-Catholic clergy, who viewed the liturgies of the Book of Common Prayer as insufficient expressions of fully Catholic worship. The translation of the Roman Missal from Latin into the stylized Elizabethan Early Modern English of the Book of Common Prayer allowed clergy to preserve the use of the vernacular language while adopting the Roman Catholic texts and liturgical rubrics. The only difference in content from the Roman Missal of the time is The English Missal inclusion of certain texts from the Book of Common Prayer, including optional prayers from the ordinary of the Prayer Book's Communion Service and the lessons for Sundays and major feast days from the Prayer Book's lectionary, which was itself taken from the earlier Sarum Use Mass of pre-Reformation England. After the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874 threatened imprisonment for priests using ritualist liturgical practices, a custom arose of the celebrant saying the Roman Canon in Latin to himself silently (i.e., sotto voce, in a soft voice) in addition to saying the official texts of the Book of Common Prayer aloud. While enforcement of the Public Worship Regulation Act ended in 1906, the custom persisted, due in part to the fact that in the pre-Vatican II Roman Rite the Canon of the Mass was always said likewise quietly. For this reason, the Latin text of the Canon of the Mass was included in The English Missal in addition to the English translation. The English Missal went through five editions. The first four were based on the Roman Missal of Pius V as revised until the time of Pope Pius X. The last edition includes the revised Roman Catholic Holy Week of 1958. One American edition includes material that conforms to the American 1928 Book of Common Prayer. Influence and legacy The Swahili liturgy approved for use in the Anglican Diocese of Zanzibar permitted the usage of the English Missal'''s prefaces, these being taken from the 1662 prayer book and the Roman Missal. In the aftermath of the Second Vatican Council and the subsequent authorization of new typical editions of the Roman Missal with official translations in English, the use of The English Missal has greatly declined. Especially in England, the English version of the Roman Missal is widely used in Anglo-Catholic parishes. However, the use of The English Missal continues in a small number of liturgically traditional Anglican parish churches in England and the United States. In 2021, The English Missal'' was adopted by the Oxford English Missal Society, which has since organized Masses according to the missal at Pusey House and elsewhere in the Oxford area.

{"text": "San Donà di Piave (; ) is a city and comune in the Metropolitan City of Venice, Veneto, northern Italy. It is one of the historical main towns of the Eastern Veneto territory, although it was totally reconstructed in the early 1920s after being heavily damaged during the World War I. Geography San Donà lies on the river Piave from Venice, from Treviso, and from Pordenone. San Donà and the surrounding cities in Veneto are known for being foggy in the autumn and the winter months. It bounds the communes of Noventa di Piave, Musile di Piave and Fossalta di Piave, that have become in practice a part of a single urban area, also known as Città del Piave. Besides, San Donà borders on the territories of Jesolo, Eraclea, Ceggia, Torre di Mosto, Cessalto and Salgareda. History The area was inhabited since the prehistoric age: the archeological researches that have taken place during the 20th century have revealed traces of a Neolithic village in the neighbourhood of Chiesanuova, on the left bank of the river Piave Moreover, significant traces of centuriation and the presence of an articulate road network make suppose that the zone was inhabited also during the Roman age. During the Dark Ages the fate of the area was band to the city of Heraclia, episcopal location and first capital of the Duchy of Venice. The city, grown in the 7th century in the area of the suburb of Cittanova, disappeared in the 9th century. After the year 1000, in the modern town's territory, two villages were built: San Donato and Mussetta. They were at first subject to the temporal jurisdiction (papacy) of the patriarchy of Aquileia and then they were affected by the events of the Ezzelini family. The village of Mussetta was situated in the north, close to a castle built by the patriarchs of Aquileia, while the village of San Donato was situated in the south, surrounding a chapel which was present since 1154. In 1250 the area experienced a catastrophic flood from the river Piave, which changed its course, moving the chapel from the left bank to the right one. This deviation implied the separation of the church from its reference area, that started to be called \"San Donato de qua de la Piave\" to be distinct from the area closest to the chapel: \"San Donato oltre la Piave\" (the current Musile di Piave). During the 13th and 14th centuries the area was in a strategic position between the Marca Trevigiana and the Republic of Venice and for these reasons was exposed to plunders and destructions, ended with the occupation of the area by the troops of Sigismund of Luxemburg and the destruction of Mussetta. At the end of the war between the Republic of Venice and the United Kingdom, the Republic incentivized the development of the territory, offering tax exemptions to the farmers that were inclined to move in the territory of San Donà. As a matter of fact, Venice was straight interested in this area since most of the town's surface was state-owned property. During the Modern era, the Republic of Venice started some reclamation interventions in the area of Basso Piave and assigned the management of the territory to a functionary. In 1468 compelling financial needs induced the Republic to give the Gastaldia of the town in emphyteusis. In 1475 it was assigned to Francesco Marcello and Angelo Trevisan, and it later became private property of the Trevisan family. The public authority was held by a functionary nominated by the Doge, the Ducal Vicarial, who had the duty to pledge the oath of allegiance to the Republic and to reside in San Donà. The first Vicarial, Antonio Lupo, was installed in 1476 by the Doge Pietro Mocenigo. During the same year, the construction of a new church started, it was dedicated to Blessed Virgin Mary and consecrated in July 1480. The growth and the development of the urban center was difficult at the beginning, especially because of the instable hydro balance. In order to preserve the lagoon from the periodical floods caused by the river, during the 16th and 17th centuries the Republic of Venice promoted some hydraulic works, deviating the courses of the rivers that were present. In 1797 was established the municipality of San Donà, administrative center of one of the fifteen cantons of the Treviso's district. With the annexation of Venice and its dependency to the Napoleonic Italian Kingdom, on May 1, 1806 the Department of Adriatic was created and the town of San Donà was part of it as administrative center of the territory of the same name. At the beginning of the 19th century, were created the first consortiums for the reclamation of the swampland at east and south of the urban center, while the city was significantly increasing its administrative functions. The city of San Donà was part of the Lombard-Venetian Kingdom from 1815 and during the Austrian domination it kept its position of county seat of the district. In the first part of the 19th century the urban center was enriched with palaces, commercial buildings and a new cathedral, realized from 1838 and 1841. With the annexation of Veneto to the Kingdom of Italy, new hydraulic works was made in the area, scarring the environmental metamorphosis and increasing the productivity of the area. Railway and steamboat connections were created, the road network was expanded and new industries and services for the population were started. The impact of the First World War on the city was devastating. After the barging of the Italian lines in Caporetto, the Italian army gave ground and reorganized itself on the new frontline along the river Piave. On 13 November 1917 began the long months of trench warfare, culminated in the Battle of Solstizio. In the autumn of 1918 the Italian army took the resolution offensive against the Austrian emplacement and on 31 October 1918 the city of San Donà came back to the Italian territory. At the end of the long months of combats the city infrastructures were completely destroyed and most of the architectural and artistic patrimony was lost. The first postwar period was characterized by the complete reconstruction of the city and by the renovation of the socio-economic activities, of the traffic between the city and the other districts and of the railway service. In 1940 Italy went to war alongside of Germany. After 8 September 1943 hundreds of citizens were engaged in the Italian resistance movement. In 1944 the city was exposed to several bombardments: during the aerial raid both the Verdi Theater and the Umberto I Hospital were destroyed. On 25 April 1945, in the presence of six thousands German soldiers, was proclaimed the insurrection of the city, and in the same day, the town of San Donà was free. San Donà is now a crucial point of the transport infrastructures between Vento and Friuli Venezia-Giulia, crossroad between the industrial development zone in the area of Treviso and the tourist attractions of Cavallino-Treporti, Jesolo, Eraclea and Caorle. Culture The friendship pact Seven centuries ago, during the Middle Ages, San Donà and the close village of Musile di Piave were two small communities of the wetland situated north-east of Venetian Lagoon. The \"friendship pact\" between the two communities combines historical fact and legend. In 1258 (according to the historian Plateo) or in 1383 (according to other scholar) the Piave River changed its course naturally. At that time the river marked the boundary between two dioceses: the Patriarch of Aquileia on the eastern side and the diocese of Torcello (Venice) on the other one. The church of San Donato (Saint Donatus), which was previously on the eastern side of the river Piave, and therefore on the side of San Donà, after the flood was on the western side of the river in the current territory of Musile di Piave. Thus the village of San Donà (whose name is the truncated form of San Donato) lost its identity symbol. Hence the compromise: San Donà kept the name of the saint, but its population must reward that one of Musile with two capons (\"gallos eviratos duos\") on August 7 of each year. Moreover, the community of Musile retained the right to make the traditional feast in honor of the parish patron saint. This is the synthesis of \"friendship pact\": every year on August 7, the payment of tribute is repeated. The tradition has been restored in a rich ceremony with a great attention to the historical details under the patronage of the Veneto Region.

{"text": "Battle-Cry is a combat board game set in the American Civil War that was published by the Milton Bradley Company in 1961 as part of their popular American Heritage series. Description Battle-Cry is a two-player board game between units representing the Union and Confederate armies. There are also special rules for a 4-player game. Components square-grid map is of the Eastern United States at the time of the American Civil War. 44 playing pieces (22 blue, 22 gray) rulebook two six-sided dice Set up Each player begins with 22 color-coded counters (10 infantry, 10 cavalry and 2 artillery), which are set up on the map on specified starting locations. Movement The active player rolls two 6-sided dice; the resultant total can be allocated as movement to any units. Infantry moves one square per dice pip, cavalry moves two squares per pip. Any unit reaching a mountain square must stop for the rest of the turn. Units at a railway station can each use 1 movement to immediately move to the next station. Combat The attacker lines up a column of pieces either horizontally or vertically to attack an enemy column. In order to begin combat, the attacker's column must have numerical superiority, calculated as 2 points for each infantry and artillery unit, and 1 point for cavalry units. All units in the defending column are eliminated, and the rear-most unit in the attacker's column is moved to the front of the attacker's column. Victory conditions The first side to eliminate all enemy pieces is the winner. Publication history Battle Cry was published as a cooperative effort between Milton Bradley and American Heritage to mark the 100th anniversary of the American Civil War. It was one of a series of four collaborative games that the two companies published, the others being Hit the Beach (a Pacific Theater of World War II-based island hopping title), Broadside (a naval game set during the War of 1812), and Dogfight (a World War I air combat game). Although the designer was not credited, box cover art was by James Walker. Battle Cry was reprinted in the 1970s. Reception In the paper La simulación histórica y la historia militar, Antonio Catalán called the American Heritage series, of which Battle Cry was one, a significant development in the study of conflict through simulations. In the essay The War in Cardboard and Ink: Fifty Years of Civil War Board Games (published in the 2014 book The Civil War in Popular Culture: Memory and Meaning), Alfred Wallace noted that this game \"was almost certainly the best-selling game on the Civil War.\" The website The Player's Aid noted that this was \"a really good and fun game.\" The reviewer found that \"while the game is simple on the surface, there is definitely some hidden strategy and tactical acumen needed to be successful.\" Other recognition A copy of Battle Cry is held in the collection of the Strong National Museum of Play (object 116.3755).

{"text": "Arthur Aston Luce (21 August 1882 – 28 June 1977) was professor of philosophy at Trinity College Dublin, and also Precentor of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin (1952–1973). Luce held many clerical appointments, including Vice-Provost of Trinity from 1946 to 1952. He was widely known as an authority on the philosopher George Berkeley. His fellowship of Trinity College from 1912 to 1977 is a record. Life Education Luce was born in Gloucester on 21 August 1882. He was the fourth son of the Reverend John James Luce and Alice Luce (née Stubbs). He was educated at Lindley Lodge School and Eastbourne College. He entered Trinity College Dublin in 1901. He obtained his BA in 1905, BD in 1908 and MA in 1911. Early academic work Luce's earlier work focuses largely on theological matters within Christianity. His academic career was interrupted by World War I, in which he served with the 12th Royal Irish Rifles. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1917. After the war, he published \"Monophysitism Past and Present\" (1921), which deals with the nature of Jesus and his relationship to the world. The following year, he published his Donnellan Lectures on Henri Bergson where he examined issues in psychology and evolution as well as religion. Work on Berkeley From the 1930s, Luce became interested in the Irish philosopher George Berkeley. Luce felt many of the previous studies of Berkeley were in many ways inadequate and sometimes wrong. His unearthing of new sources on Berkeley as well as better ways of interpreting existing sources guided Luce's work in this direction. Luce stressed the role of the French monk Malebranche on influencing the thought of the young Berkeley. Prior to Luce's Berkeley and Malebranche (1934) Berkeley had been seen almost solely in the patrimony of John Locke and empiricism. Berkeley's mature philosophy was given lucid exposition by Luce in his 1945 work \"Berkeley's Immaterialism\". Along with Thomas Edmund Jessop he edited The Works of George Berkeley (in nine volumes, 1948–1957). Luce was not only a Berkeley scholar but came to be a believer in Berkelianism itself. In \"Sense without Matter\" (1954) Luce attempts to bring Berkeley up to date by modernising the philosophers vocabulary and putting the issues Berkeley faced in today's terms. In this work, Luce also treats of the Biblical account of matter (or rather the lack of such an account) and the psychology of perception and nature. Berkeley's personal reputation among historians and the public was also an area which Luce felt needed correcting and updating. Some studies of Berkeley had contributed to his reputation as a dreamer or a loner who often hid his real views. Luce's \"Life of George Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne\" (1949) takes aim at this picture of Berkeley and by careful use of (often new) sources paints a more grounded picture of the man. Personal life In 1918, Luce married Lilian Mary Thomson, with whom he had three children. His wife and young daughter drowned in 1940. His elder son Professor John Victor Luce (1920–2011) was also an academic at Trinity and also served as vice-provost. His original academic work and numerous administrative and clerical appointments earned him a solid local and international reputation. He was regarded as a fine preacher and respected tutor. His hobbies were chess and particularly angling on which he wrote a book (\"Fishing and Thinking\" 1959) which is regarded highly among anglers: to his freshmen philosophy students, he would muse, \"fishing and philosophy: trout and truth!\" He died, shortly after an assault, on 28 June 1977.

{"text": "Stopped-flow is an experimental technique for studying chemical reactions with a half time of the order of 1 ms, introduced by Britton Chance and extended by Quentin Gibson (Other techniques, such as the temperature-jump method, are available for much faster processes.) Description of the method Summary Stopped-flow spectrometry allows chemical kinetics of fast reactions (with half times of the order of milliseconds) to be studied in solution. It was first used primarily to study enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Then the stopped-flow rapidly found its place in almost all biochemistry, biophysics, and chemistry laboratories with a need to follow chemical reactions in the millisecond time scale. In its simplest form, a stopped-flow mixes two solutions. Small volumes of solutions are rapidly and continuously driven into a high-efficiency mixer. This mixing process then initiates an extremely fast reaction. The newly mixed solution travels to the observation cell and pushes out the contents of the cell (the solution remaining from the previous experiment or from necessary washing steps). The time required for this solution to pass from the mixing point to the observation point is known as dead time. The minimum injection volume will depend on the volume of the mixing cell. Once enough solution has been injected to completely remove the previous solution, the instrument reaches a stationary state and the flow can be stopped. Depending on the syringe drive technology, the flow stop is achieved by using a stop valve called the hard-stop or by using a stop syringe. The stopped-flow also sends a ‘start signal’ to the detector called the trigger so the reaction can be observed. The timing of the trigger is usually software controlled so the user can trigger at the same time the flow stops or a few milliseconds before the stop to check the stationary state has been reached. So this is a very economical technique. Reactant syringes Two syringes are filled with solutions that do not undergo a chemical reaction until mixed together. These have pistons that are driven by a single drive piston or by independent stepping motors, so that they are coupled together and their contents are forced out simultaneously into a mixing device. Mixing chamber Once the two solutions are forced out of their syringes they enter a mixing system that has baffles to ensure complete mixing, with turbulent flow rather than laminar flow, which would allow the two solutions to flow side by side with incomplete mixing. Dead time The dead time is the time for the solutions to go from the mixing point to the observation point, it is the part of the kinetics which cannot be observed. So the lower the dead time, the more information the user can get. In older instruments this could be of the order of 1 ms, but improvements now allow a dead time of about 0.3 ms. Observation cell The mixed reactants pass an observation cell that allows the reaction to be followed spectrophotometrically, typically by ultraviolet spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism or light scattering, and it is now common to combine several of these. Observation cuvette with a short light path (0.75 to 1.5mm) are usually preferred for fluorescence measurements to reduce self-absorption effects. Observation cuvette with longer light path (0.5 cm to 1 cm) are preferred for absorbance measurements. Modern stopped-flow can accommodate different models of cells and it is possible to change the cuvette between two experiments. For stopped-flow X-ray measurements, a quartz capillary with thin wall is used to minimize quartz absorption. Simultaneous x-ray and absorbance measurements are possible in the same capillary. Stopping Once through the observation cell the mixture enters a third syringe that contains a piston that is driven by the flow to activate a switch to stop the flow and activate the observation. Continuous flow The stopped-flow method is a development of the continuous-flow method used by Hamilton Hartridge and Francis Roughton to study the binding of O2 to hemoglobin. In the absence of any stopping system the reaction mixture passed to a long tube past an observation system (consisting in 1923 of a simple colorimeter) to waste. By moving the colorimeter along the tube, and knowing the flow rate, Hartridge and Roughton could measure the process after a known time. In its time this was a revolutionary advance showing an apparently intractable problem (studying a process taking milliseconds with equipment that required seconds for each measurement) could be solved with simple equipment. However, in practice it was limited to reactants available in large quantities: for proteins this effectively limited it to reactions of hemoglobin. For practical purposes this approach is obsolete. Quenched flow The stopped-flow method depends on the existence of spectroscopic properties that can be used for following the reaction. When that is not the case quenched flow provides an alternative that uses conventional chemical methods for analysis. Instead of a mechanical stopping system the reaction is stopped by quenching, the products being delivered to a recipient that stops the reaction immediately, either by instantaneous freezing or by denaturing the enzyme with a chemical denaturant or exposing the sample to a denaturing light source. As in the continuous-flow method, the time between mixing and quenching can be varied by varying the length of the tube. The pulsed quenched flow method introduced by Alan Fersht and Ross Jakes overcomes the need for a long tube. The reaction is initiated exactly as in a stopped-flow experiment, but there is a third syringe that brings about quenching a definite and preset time after the initiation. Quenched flow has both advantages and disadvantages with respect to stopped flow. On the one hand, chemical analysis makes it clear what process is being measured, whereas it may not always be obvious what process a spectroscopic signal represents. On the other hand, quenched flow is much more laborious, as each point along the time course must be determined separately. The image at left for catalysis by nitrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae illustrates both of these points: the agreement in half times indicates that the absorbance at 420 nm measured the release of Pi, but the quenched-flow experiment required 11 data points.

{"text": "Kenneth John Irvine (5 March 1940 – 22 December 1990), also nicknamed \"Mongo\", was an Australian professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. He holds the standing Australian record for the most tries in a first-grade career – 212. No other player has yet managed 200 tries in their Australian club career, with the closest to Irvine's tally being Melbourne Storm player Billy Slater, who scored 190. He is also the 2nd all-time top try-scorer for the Australian national team with 33, two behind Darren Lockyer's 35. Irvine's great speed is legendary and he is regarded as Australia's greatest ever winger, being named in 2008 in the list of Australian rugby league's 100 greatest players, as well as being an automatic selection for the Australian Rugby League's \"Team of the Century\". Irvine played his club football for the North Sydney and Manly-Warringah clubs in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership, winning the premiership with Manly in 1972 and 1973. His great speed saw him play primarily on the . Early life Born in Cremorne, Sydney, to John Bernard Irvine, a butcher, and his wife Doris May ( McCabe), Irvine attended Marist Brothers College Mosman. He originally excelled in both baseball and sprinting, playing in the New South Wales junior baseball side alongside future New South Wales and Australian teammate Reg Gasnier, while also competitively running for the Randwick-Botany Club. After deciding to attend a trial at Wentworth Park for the North Sydney Bears rugby league club as a 17-year-old, their first grade coach Ross McKinnon stated \"sign that kid for life\", and Ken was signed and playing for the club the following year. Playing career North Sydney Bears Making his debut for the club on the wing in 1958, he was an instant success for the club, proving to be a frequent try scorer. After only one full club season with Norths, Irvine was selected for New South Wales in 1959. He was the 1959 NSWRFL season's leading try-scorer with 19 and was rewarded with selection in the Australian side for the 1959-60 Kangaroo tour. Irvine made his Australian debut on the tour against France at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris on 31 October 1959. In 1961, Irvine showcased his speed at a specially-arranged event specifically in an attempt to break professional world record over 100 yards. Irvine won the event and equaled the record of 9.3 seconds. During the same event he would also win the 120-yard Dubbo Gift after starting a yard behind scratch, again displaying his much-publicised speed. Irvine's speed was such that he is still considered by many to be the fastest player ever to lace on a boot, and is favorably compared against other noted rugby league speedsters such as Johnny Bliss, Michael Cleary (a 1962 Commonwealth Games 100 yards Bronze Medallist who beat Irvine in a A£2,000 match race at Sydney's Wentworth Park in 1964), Martin Offiah and Darren Albert. In total, Ken Irvine was selected for three Kangaroo Tours. He toured in 1959–60, 1963–64 where he repeated his feat from 1962 of being the only Australian to score a try in each test of an Ashes series against Great Britain including 3 tries in the 50-12 second test win at Station Road in Swinton in a game that became known as the \"Swinton Massacre\", and finally 1967–68. Irvine's feat of scoring a try in each test of an Ashes series against Great Britain was later equalled by Sam Backo in 1988 and Mal Meninga in 1990. Ken Irvine was involved in one of the most talked about and controversial passages of play in rugby league test match history in 1962. In the third Ashes test against Great Britain at the Sydney Cricket Ground, referee Darcy Lawler awarded a try to Irvine late in the game, ignoring a forward pass from Bill Carson amid howls of protest from Lions players. Australian captain Arthur Summons then gave him the goal kicking duties leaving him with a sideline conversion. As he lined the ball up for the kick, Lawler allegedly gave Irvine some 'advice' about how the ball was placed, telling him that he would miss the kick if he didn't line the ball correctly (Irvine denied this in his memoirs, though Lawler maintained until his death in 2004 that it was true). Irvine then moved in and re-adjusted the ball, walked back to his mark and kicked the goal. The goal gave Australia a 17–16 win and in doing so saw to it that they avoided losing the series 3–0 to the tourists after the Lions had won the first test 31–12 in Sydney and the second 17–10 at Lang Park in Brisbane. Irvine's Test career ended in 1968 when he suffered a broken leg against in the first test against France on the 1967-68 Kangaroo tour at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, ruling him out for much of the 1969 NSWRFL season. Irvine had the honour of captaining the Bears on occasions, although he infamously threatened to lead his team off in protest of referee Keith Page during a 1970 match against Canterbury-Bankstown at Belmore Sports Ground (Norths won the game 9–8). He would go on to make 176 appearances for the side, scoring 171 tries. His stint with the Bears ended at the end of 1970 after disagreements with head coach Roy Francis. Ken Arthurson who was the club secretary at Manly spoke to the media in 2016 and talked about Irvine's defection to The Northern Beaches club saying \"I asked Ken if he had given careful thought about the reprecussions if he left Norths, I said you are a legend there and you are sacrificing so much, I won't be happy until you have given it a lot of deep thought and talked it over with your family\". Irvine reportedly replied that he had burnt his bridges at Norths and there was no going back. Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Irvine was quickly signed by Manly club secretary Ken Arthurson in 1971. The Sea Eagles club Secretary knew the value of adding the games best winger to what was already a quality team that included the likes of Bob Fulton, Fred Jones, Mal Reilly, Bill Hamilton, Graham Eadie and Terry Randall. Irvine went on to make 60 appearances for the club, scoring 41 tries and showed he had lost none of his speed at the end of his career. He overtook Harold Horder as the NSWRFL's all-time top try-scorer, and was finally able to win a premiership when he helped Manly to claim successive premierships in 1972 (19-14 over Eastern Suburbs) and 1973 (10-7 over Cronulla-Sutherland). Irvine didn't score a try in either of his Grand Final wins with the Sea Eagles. Ken Irvine retired after the 1973 Grand Final win over Cronulla, becoming the first player to score 200 tries in NSWRFL Premiership history. As of April 2018 Irvine holds the record for tries scored in the premiership (212) in front of Steve Menzies (180), Billy Slater (188), Andrew Ettingshausen (165), Terry Lamb (164) and Brett Stewart (162). Records and statistics Irvine's 212 career tries is the standing NSWRL/NRL career record for the most first grade tries. This tally was achieved in only 236 first grade games and is 22 tries clear of his nearest rival in the rankings: Billy Slater, 32 ahead of Steve Menzies, and almost 50 ahead of Andrew Ettingshausen, Terry Lamb and Brett Stewart. Menzies, Ettingshausen and Lamb achieved their 160+ totals in 349, 328 and 350 first grade games respectively. Irvine held the record for the highest number of tries scored for a single club, recording 171 tries during 176 games at North Sydney between 1958 and 1970. However, this was surpassed in 2015 by Melbourne Storm's fullback Billy Slater. Irvine's 33 tries for Australia was eclipsed by Darren Lockyer during the 2010 Four Nations tournament against Papua New Guinea. Lockyer, who started his test career at before moving to , broke Irvine's record while playing in his 52nd test. Ken Irvine scored his 33 tries in 33 test matches, scoring at the remarkable rate of one try per test. Point scoring summary (Note – the above total represents points the total for points at the value they were during Irvine's playing days. Since his retirement, field goals have been reduced from two points to one while tries have increased from three points to four. Adjusted for 2016 figures, Ken Irvine would have scored 989 points in club football) Career statistics Post-playing Irvine was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia in 1983. On 22 December 1990, Irvine died of the disease at the age of 50 in Brisbane. North Sydney Oval's Ken Irvine Scoreboard was named in his honour in 1991. Accolades Irvine was inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame in 2004. In August, 2006 he was named at winger in the North Sydney Bears' Team of the Century. In 2006 Ken Irvine was named on the wing for the Manly Sea Eagles Dream Team to celebrate the club's 60th anniversary. The team, selected by a panel of selectors which featured former Manly-Warringah administrator Ken Arthurson, respected rugby league writer Ian Heads, the club Chairman Kerry Sibraa and journalist Phil Rothfield, included six of Irvine's teammates from the 1972 and 1973 premiership teams. In 2007 Irvine was selected by a panel of experts as a winger in an Australian 'Team of the 50s'. In February 2008, Irvine was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. Irvine went on to be named as one of the wingers, along with Brian Bevan, in Australian rugby league's Team of the Century. Announced on 17 April 2008, the team is the panel's majority choice for each of the thirteen starting positions and four interchange players. In 2008 New South Wales announced their rugby league team of the century and Irvine was again named on the wing. Irvine set the world professional sprint record for 100 yards in 1963, running 100 yards (91 m) in 9.3 seconds at Dubbo. He is the only rugby league player to hold a world professional sprint record. In 2018, the award for the NRL's top tryscorer for the season was named the Ken Irvine Medal, with David Fusitu'a from the New Zealand Warriors being the inaugural winner (with 23 tries) References External links Ken Irvine at northsydneybears.com.au Ken Irvine at eraofthebiff.com 20th Century Top 10 Rugby League Players 1940 births 1990 deaths Australian rugby league players Rugby league players from Sydney North Sydney Bears players Manly Warringah Sea Eagles players Australia national rugby league team players New South Wales rugby league team players Rugby league wingers Deaths from leukemia Deaths from cancer in Queensland"}

{"text": "Robin Huw Bowen (born 1957) is a player of the Welsh triple harp, known in Welsh as Telyn Deires (),. He was awarded the Glyndŵr Award in 2000. Born into the Welsh community in Liverpool, England, into a family originally from Anglesey, Bowen learned to play the Celtic Harp while at school, inspired by the Breton harper, Alan Stivell. In 1979 he received a degree in Welsh Language and Literature from the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. He was first exposed to the Welsh Triple Harp by two members of the Welsh traditional music group Ar Log, brothers Dafydd and Gwyndaf Roberts. They had learned to play the instrument from Nansi Richards, one of the last traditional Welsh folk harpists from the previous generation. Although he regularly performs as a soloist, Bowen joined the Welsh traditional group Mabsant in 1986 and later joined Cusan Tân. Since 1998 he has been a member of the Welsh 'super-group' Crasdant. In 2004 he and four other Triple Harpists formed Rhes Ganol, the first Welsh Triple Harp 'Choir' to exist since that of Llanover Hall during its heyday at the beginning of the twentieth century. Robin Huw Bowen worked for many years at the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. While there he discovered several old collections of Welsh tunes and arrangements for harp, some of which have since been published. His research has also drawn on living sources, in particular the harpist Eldra Jarman (1917–2000), a great-granddaughter of .

{"text": "The International Labor Rights Forum (ILRF) is a nonprofit advocacy organization headquartered in Washington, D.C., U.S., that describes itself as \"an advocate for and with the working poor around the world.\" ILRF, formerly the \"International Labor Rights Education & Research Fund\", was founded in 1986, and the organization's mission statement reads: \"ILRF believes that all workers have the right to a safe working environment where they are treated with dignity and respect, and where they can organize freely to defend and promote their rights and interests. ILRF works to develop practical and effective tools to assist workers in winning enforcement of protections for their basic rights, and hold labor rights violators accountable.\" History After Kailash Satyarthi and Bread for the World founded Rugmark in 1994, ILRF helped the nascent foundation open a U.S.-based office in Washington, D.C., in 1995. The two groups continued to share offices afterward. In 2007, the litigation department of ILRF, noted for its use of the Alien Tort Claims Act in litigation against those who violate labor rights, was spun off into a separate organization, International Rights Advocates (\"IRAdvocates\"). Although it retains legal staff, the ILRF focuses primarily on research, lobbying, boycott campaigns and various other advocacy roles. Rana Plaza collapse After the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory on April 24, 2013, the ILRF appeared in the media to provide an analysis on the overall situation and respond to the actions of associated companies in the wake of the incident. The collapse resulted in the death of 1,129 garment workers, highlighting working conditions that were described as those of a \"sweatshop\" and remuneration that was considered \"subsistence,\" while garments of high-end fashion labels and the U.S. government were found in the rubble. Liana Foxvog, ILRF's director of organizing and communications at the time, commented in regard to the U.S. government garments that were found: ... the fact that Marines' logo clothing was found in the rubble of the sweatshop fire should serve as a wake-up call to the U.S. Government to put into place safeguards to ensure decent working conditions in government supply chains and among licensees. In June 2013, U.S. President Barack Obama announced the suspension of trade privileges with the Bangladeshi government until significant labor issues were resolved. By July 2013, the \"Bangladesh Worker Safety Initiative\" proposal was released by the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which was formed by a group of North American companies involved with the Bangladeshi manufacturing sector, including Walmart, Target, J.C. Penney and Gap. The key amendments of the proposal were the establishment of a hotline for workers to report concerns, the completion of inspections and the funding of safety upgrades to the garment facilities. The companies behind the Worker Safety Initiative had raised US$42 million worth of grants to improve factory infrastructure, and $100 million in low-rate loans and access to capital. The ILRF was critical of the Worker Safety Initiative and Foxvog explained to the media that: the proposal was not legally binding; the hotline was ineffective because complaints would be received by the company without the involvement of an independent party; and the corresponding funds were insufficient. The ILRF, as well as other experts in the area, had calculated that it would cost around US$300,000 to $500,000 for each factory to be upgraded, meaning that a total of at least $1 billion was required to fulfill the aim of the Worker Safety Initiative. Furthermore, the ILRF, which was supported by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL–CIO) U.S. trade union federation, stated that workers would still require their wages while the renovations were being undertaken to survive. The ILRF dismissed claims by the National Retail Federation, which feared the instatement of an increased legal liability upon the clothing companies, and supported the \"Accord on Fire and Building Safety\" that had been signed by European companies and some U.S. brands by July 2013. The Accord was legally binding and provided workers with the ability to seek arbitration for their grievances, which could result in a fine for the company if a breach was detected—Foxvog stated that the Accord allowed for a neutral arbiter and was not related to a class action. The ILRF then published a December 2013 article, in which it ordered for the U.S. federal government to enforce labor standards for overseas procurement, including the option to sanction contractor firms that \"do not comply with applicable laws and regulations and internationally accepted labor standards.\" The importance of independent monitoring and the engagement of workers and unions were also emphasized by the ILRF. Björn Skorpen Claeson, an ILRF senior policy analyst at the time, said to the Huffington Post: The government should expect to pay for products made in decent working conditions, in compliance with all applicable labor standards, by workers who earn a living wage—that is, a fair price. ... In the context of procurement, paying a fair price is the way the government \"invests\" in compliance. The Dangerous Silence: Exchanges Turn Blind Eye to Suppliers report was published by the ILRF on February 12, 2014, highlighting the role of U.S. military exchanges in the Bangladeshi garment industry. The report, of which Claeson is the principal author, states that some of the military exchanges \"remain ignorant of flagrant violations in their supplier factories, because the industry audit reports failed to disclose them.\" The director of the ILRF at the time, Judy Gearhart, said that \"it's not acceptable for U.S. government-owned companies to be not holding up the highest bar\" and that the issue presents a \"huge risk\" to the reputation of the U.S. Activities ILRF, working in coalition with other human rights and sweatshop-oriented NGOs, uses a diverse range of mechanisms to promote its vision of labor rights. According to its website, the ILRF has worked directly to promote labor rights through: Research and publication Public campaigning and media outreach Promoting new International Labour Organization Conventions and their ratification Promoting reform of US legislation Advising multinational corporations on issues of corporate social responsibility Using litigation, especially the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA), to hold corporations accountable Using trade-related complaints processes to hold governments accountable Campaigns Fairness in Flowers ILRF's Fairness in Flowers Campaign was launched in 2003 to promote the rights of workers in the cut flower industry. ILRF advocates on behalf of the workers, supports a legal center in Ecuador that helps them bring work-related grievances against their employers, and collaborates with certification initiatives like Fair Flowers Fair Plants (FFP) and Veriflora. Child labor Approximately 211 million of the world's children, between the ages of 5 and 14, work at least part-time, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the tripartite body representing governments, labor, and employees. Of these, 120 million children are working full-time to help support their impoverished families. Although child labor is most common in developing countries, it is found throughout the world, including in the United States. Many of these children are forced into the workforce to become beggars, farm hands, and factory workers. They are exposed to conditions extremely harmful to their physical and mental well-being. ILRF has helped develop programs to fight child labor and is involved in monitoring conditions in various regions of the world. ILRF is also currently engaged in two corporate campaigns related to child labor: one targeting the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company for their use of child labor on a rubber plantation in Liberia and the other focusing on the chocolate industry for child labor on cocoa farms in West Africa. Rights For Working Women Campaign ILRF has recently developed a Rights For Working Women Campaign which seeks to alleviate labor conditions that disproportionately affect working women in developing countries through research, public education, litigation, legislative action, and grassroots mobilization. To begin the campaign, ILRF has undertaken a global initiative to promote increased awareness of and viable remedies for the problem of workplace sexual harassment. As of 1997, there were only thirty-six countries with legislation specifically targeting sexual harassment. Of those countries, only 12 were from Latin America, the Caribbean or Africa. It is not uncommon for women to be subjected to bodily searches or fired for refusing sexual advances. The prevalence of subcontracting and other forms of \"flexible\" work arrangements in the global economy make it very difficult for women to organize against such abuse. Accord on Fire and Building Safety Designed to hold companies around the world accountable to worker safety in sweatshop conditions, ILRF created the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in 2012. As of July 2017, the accord has been signed by over 200 apparel companies. A list of 14 U.S. companies refused to sign the accord: Walmart, Gap, Macy's, Sears/Kmart, J. C. Penney, VF Corp., Target, Kohl's, Cato Fashions, Carter's, Nordstrom, American Eagle Outfitters, The Children's Place, and Foot Locker.

In 2006, he returned to Napoli, where he was eventually named the club's captain and contributed to the club's resurgence: he helped the team to earn promotion to Serie A in his first season and subsequently aided his side to qualify for the UEFA Cup in 2008, earn a spot in the Champions League in 2011 and win the Coppa Italia in 2012, the club's first title in over 20 years.

Following the conclusion of his professional football career, he joined his brother as a member of the team's coaching staff at Guangzhou Evergrande and Benevento. Early life Cannavaro was born in Naples on 26 June 1981. He is the younger brother of former football defender Fabio Cannavaro. His nephew and son of Fabio Cannavaro, Christian, is also a footballer, who currently plays as a midfielder for Benevento and previously played for Paolo's former club Sassuolo. His son Manuel (born 2002) is a professional footballer, playing as a central midfielder for Taranto as of 2021. Club career Early career Cannavaro made his professional debut for his hometown side Napoli during the 1998–99 season in Serie B, while he was 17 years old. The following season he was signed by Parma, playing alongside his older brother Fabio in his first season at the club. Paolo's debut for Parma came when he replaced his brother as a substitute in Parma's 4–1 victory against Lecce. Parma and Verona Verona took the player on loan during the 2001–02 season; Cannavaro made 25 appearances for the club, scoring his first professional goal. The following year he returned to Parma where he spent much of the time as a substitute for the following two seasons (2002–03 and 2003–04). During the 2004–05 season, Cannavaro became more active in the first team at Parma, making 24 appearances and scoring 4 goals from defence, also helping the club to reach the 2004–05 UEFA Cup semi-final. Napoli As Napoli had been recently promoted back into Serie B and were looking to build a squad with potential, Cannavaro was brought back to his first club in 2006. After helping to re-establish the club in the top flight of Italian football in his first season back, Cannavaro was installed as the team's captain the following season and subsequently played a key role in the club's resurgence, helped his team to qualify for the UEFA Cup in 2008: he later also helped his team to earn a spot in the Champions League in 2011 and lifted the club's first major trophy in more than 20 years when Napoli defeated Juventus 2–0 in the Coppa Italia final in Rome on 20 May 2012. The following season, Napoli were defeated by Juventus 4–2 in extra time in the 2012 Supercoppa Italiana in Beijing on 11 August. Sassuolo On 31 January 2014, Cannavaro joined Sassuolo on loan for the remainder of the season for free, helping the newly promoted club to avoid relegation. Sassuolo signed Cannavaro outright for a fee of €1,000 in the summer of 2014 on a three-year contract. In December 2017, Cannavaro announced that he would be retiring from professional football at the end of the month; he made his final appearance in Serie A on 30 December, in a 1–1 away draw against Roma. International career As a youngster, Cannavaro played for Italy under-21 national football team on 18 occasions between 2002 and 2004, notably representing the Italy under-21 side at the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, where they reached the semi-finals. He followed in the footsteps of his older brother by earning his first and only call up for the Italian national senior team under manager Roberto Donadoni, on 13 October 2007, for a friendly match in Florence against South Africa on 17 October, although he did not make an appearance during the match. Style of play A tall, reliable, experienced, dedicated and physically strong defender, Cannavaro was known in particular for his ability in the air. A talented defender, although tactically he was capable of playing in a four-man back-line, he was not particularly quick, therefore, due to his elegance on the ball, technique, vision, awareness and passing ability, he performed best as a ball-playing centre-back in a three-man defensive line and was known for his ability to create chances or start attacking plays from the back after winning back possession; he was also capable of playing as a right-back, although this was not his preferred position. His main defensive skills were his anticipation, marking ability, tackling, concentration and strong mental attributes. In spite of his reserved character, he was also known for his leadership qualities. Retirement Following his retirement from professional football in December 2017, Paolo joined his brother, manager Fabio Cannavaro, on the technical staff at Chinese Super League club Guangzhou Evergrande. They stayed at Guangzhou until September 2021, when they tended their resignations. He successively served as Fabio Cannavaro's assistant at Serie B club Benevento from September 2022 to February 2023. Controversy In December 2012, Cannavaro was handed a six-month ban for failing to report an attempt of match fixing by then-Napoli goalkeeper Matteo Gianello. On 17 January 2013, the ban was revoked by the FIGC after appeal and Napoli's two-point deduction was reversed. In February 2015, Cannavaro, his brother Fabio and his sister-in-law Daniela were respectively handed six-month, ten-month and four-month prison sentences for breaching orders and entering Fabio's residence after it had been seized by authorities in 2009, amid an investigation into fraudulent activity and tax evasion; all three have appealed and will have their sentences suspended until the final judgement has been made. In November 2017, following the Italy national football team's failure to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Cannavaro drew criticism in the media over a controversial Instagram post in which he blamed Italy missing out on the upcoming tournament on the influx of non-Italian footballers in Serie A over the previous 15 years. In July 2018, Cannavaro and former Napoli footballers Pepe Reina and Salvatore Aronica were subject to a hearing by the Italian Football Federation over links to the Esposito brothers, high-ranking members of the Camorra criminal organisation.

{"text": "Abagana is a town in Nigeria. It is the headquarters of Njikoka Local Government Area Anambra State and lies approximately 20 kilometers from Onitsha along the old Enugu-Onitsha Trunk A Road that divides the town into two halves. Abagana town has a landmass of approximately 9.2 square kilometers and is bounded in the north by Abba, Ukpo, and Enugu Agidi towns, in the South by Nimo Owelle and Eziowelle towns, in the East by Enugwu Ukwu town and in the west by Umunnachi and Ifitedunu towns. The traditional authority adopts the kingship title of Igwe Abagana. The current traditional ruler is His Majesty, Igwe Patrick Mbamalu Okeke. History There is no comprehensive documentary record of the origin of Abagana. There are basically three versions of the origin of Abagana as we could gather both from our raconteurs and few available records. Early Igbo history has it that Abagana, Nimo Owelle, Eziowelle, and Abba were related. According to this version, one man called Owelle migrated from an uncertain part of Igbo land, accompanied by his wife, Oma, and settled at a site between Nimo Owelle and Eziowelle in the old Onitsha district. This man gave birth to three sons and a daughter namely: Nimo (also known as Nimo Owelle: inside Owelle’s enclave/territory), Ezi (also known as Eziowelle: the road to Owelle’s home) Abagana and Abba. The fact that these towns now have one central place where they worship and celebrate an ancestral feast of brotherhood called \"Uta Nwanne na Nwanne\" seems to lend credence to this assertion of common ancestral descent. Another version of the historical origin of Abagana had it that the father of \"Abagana\" whose name was given as 'Obum' came from an unknown place and settled at a place now known as \"Nkwo Abagana\". According to Late Chief Nwankwo Okakpu, a community leader and custodian of the peoples' culture, this man gave birth to nine children whose names are: Ogidi, Okpala, Chime, Okwui, Ene, Dejili, Akpuche, Ajilija, and Uru-Ochu. The above account seems to agree with the popular aphorism, Abagana Ebo teghete, i.e. Abagana of nine clans, which obviously obliterated the initial postulation of\" Abagana Ebo n' ese, i.e. Abagana of five clans. Perhaps the most widely accepted account of the origin of Abagana is that a man called “Agana-Diese” founded Abagana. None of our oral narrators was sure of the exact place where this man migrated from, but a popular opinion and belief was that this man was banished by his people for committing an abomination and for this reason he fled his own community and settled at a place known to day as \"Nkwo-Abagana\". According to our sources mainly centenarian traditionalists, including Late Chief Ejiofor Amamchukwu (Chime Abagana), Chief Okoye Ogbantu, and Chief Okeke Ezechi; this man married and had six children, five males and one female, namely, Okpala, Diese, Akpuche, Uruochu, Ajilija, and Obum—the only female. According to these sources, these five sons of Agana-Diese were the original inhabitants of the place now called \"Abagana\", and this perhaps was the reason why we originally had \"Abagana Ebo-n' ese, i.e., Abagana of five clans. Still in line with this historical origin, a spiritual mound was erected at the ancestral place where Agana-Diese lived and reared his children. It is now at Nkwo-Abagana Square and today still serves as a symbol of unity as well as repository of spiritual power for the people of Abagana. In keeping with the tradition, a day is set aside in November every year to celebrate \"Uta-Anu\" feast of meat, as memorial for the bond of relationship. Our sources also had it that as time went on, \"Okpala\" who was then a prosperous farmer was in dire need of human assistance both for his farming activities and for physical protection of his vast and fast expanding territorial effluence. Initially, he hired a paid labourer to render the services, but as time went on, he came in contact with one great hunter called \"Dunu\" who used to come from Umunachi on hunting expeditions and engaged his services and later made him \"Dunu\", the manager of his labourers. It was gathered that Okpala later developed enormous interest in this great hunter such that he assigned a piece of land to him to build his own house and was also allowed to freely farm at available lands around his abode for his own personal purpose. For the above reason, as we were informed, this man called \"Dunu\" found good reason to settle down and later married a wife from Uru-Okpala village and gave birth to Kabi, Okpalachi, and Dilekwo. These three sons, according to our sources, now make up the three major kindred that today exist in the Umudunu village, Abagana. It is important to mention that other labourers who came together with Dunu, mainly from Awkuzu and other neighboring communities, were also allowed to co-habit the same areas with Dunu, but sometime later dispersed and went out either in Diaspora or back to their ancestral homes, but the remnants became diffused and mixed up with Dunu kindred. It is also worthy of mention that due to difficulties encountered by the children of Dunu in sourcing wives from the neighbouring communities, Dunu solved this problem by establishing a spiritual dimension called \"Iti Ofo na Ala\" which made it possible for a section of his own children to intermarry among themselves, and this has continued till today. Orofia is the second largest village in Abagana today in terms of population and land mass after Umudunu. As is the case with Umudunu, its founder was an immigrant called \"Chime\" (\"Chima\" in some dialects). According to further account of our sources, this Chime was a great warrior, adventurer, and statesman who came from \"Ohafia\" near Arochukwu in Abia State in search of slaves and merchandise. Some elders say that Chime rather came from Arochukwu but many of his followers were from Ohafia and environs. Our source had it that this man founded \"Orofia\" settlement in other towns like Nimo, Enugwu-Ukwu, Eziowelle, Alor, Umudioka, Ogbunike, Ogidi, Ukpo, Oraukwu, and others in the course of his numerous adventures and expeditions, but finally settled in Abagana with his soldiers of fortune and founded \"Orofia village Abagana\". Chime later married from Akpu Abagana and eventually crossed the River Niger with his family and followers, and in the course of the adventure, he founded Onicha Ugbo, Onicha Olona, Issele Ukwu, Issele Azagba, Issele Mkpitime, Obior, Onicha Mmiri, which are all part of the Ezechima clan in Igboland. Opinions of our sources and respondents agree that the name \"Abagana\" originated from an oral tradition that the founding father of Abagana was \"Agana-Diese\". Initially the people called themselves \"Ebe-Agana\" meaning Agana's palace. Later, during the pre-colonial era, her neighbors called them 'Mba-Agana' which means literally that strangers were not allowed passage from that land. This must be as a result of his war-like nature. During that period, colonial masters would set out from Onitsha via Awkuzu, Nando, Mgbakwu and traveled to Awka where they settled. Traveling through Abagana could have been easier and shorter for them, but the fear of Abagana was the beginning of wisdom to them. It was indeed the Europeans, who found it difficult to pronounce \"Mba-Agana\" that changed the name to \"Abagana\" for easy pronunciation just like they did in other places like Nawfia, Nawgu, Onitsha, Awkuzu etc. Abagana Ambush On March 31, 1968: Biafran army won their biggest battle. by ambushing and destroying a 96-vehicle column of Nigerian soldiers with locally hand made bomb called Ogbunigwe or bucket bomb. The humiliating Abagana defeat to Nigerian soldiers prompted General Yakubu Gowon to remove Col. Murtala Mohammed as the General Commanding Officer of the Onitsha sector.

In December, he played in the newly formed Masters France exhibition tournament for the eight French players who had performed best at the four French tournaments. He qualified from the round-robin group stage with victories against Julien Benneteau, Marc Gicquel, and Josselin Ouanna. In the final against Michaël Llodra, Llodra pulled out with a shoulder injury, resulting in Simon's becoming the inaugural winner of the tournament. 2009: Australian Open quarterfinal Simon started the year off rising to a new career high of world no. 6 and played at the Hopman Cup, teaming up with compatriot Alizé Cornet to form the French mixed doubles duo.

At the next tournament in Valencia, he lost to Mikhail Youzhny in the quarterfinal. He continued to Bercy to play at the BNP Paribas Masters. He was seeded 11th and had a first-round bye. In the second round, he faced Ivan Ljubičić. While lunging to return a wide serve, he aggravated a right knee injury that has been bothering him for half of the 2009 season. Although with his movement severely hampered, Simon decided to play on to finish the match in front of an enthusiastic home crowd. He went on to win the match. In an interview during the Paris tournament, Simon said that the doctor had recommended that he take at least two months to recover from his knee injury. 2010: Seventh ATP title Gilles started the 2010 season with an exhibition event, the World Tennis Challenge in Adelaide. It started badly for him, as he struggled with injury. He lost three straight matches, including to the home favourite Bernard Tomic. Simon pulled out of the Australian Open due to his knee injury. He did not make any appearances in the 2010 season until mid-February, at the 2010 Open 13 tournament in Marseille, losing in the first round. The right knee injury eventually caused Simon to miss the entire spring European clay season, including the French Open. He returned to the tour in mid-June, winning two rounds in Eastbourne before losing to Michaël Llodra in the quarterfinals. At the 2010 Wimbledon tournament Simon reached the third round. He began the summer US hard court season by participating in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C. reaching the quarterfinals. However, he suffered first-round defeats in his next two ATP Masters 1000 series tournaments, the 2010 Rogers Cup in Toronto and the 2010 Western & Southern Financial Group Masters and Women's Open in Cincinnati. He moved on to New York to take part in US Open, reaching the third round. He went on to meet the no. 1 player Rafael Nadal in the third round. Before the match, upon hearing about the birth of Simon's son, Nadal jokingly offered to buy Simon a flight ticket back to Europe to see his son before the match. Simon stayed, and lost to the eventual champion Nadal. Simon then entered 2010 Open de Moselle as a wildcard. Originally, he did not plan to play the tournament because his son was supposed to be due that week. He took his newly extended family to Metz and eventually won the tournament by beating Mischa Zverev in the final. This was his seventh career title, coming only weeks after the birth of his first child. During the award ceremony, he thanked his girlfriend for the support and called the victory a \"family effort.\" The rest of 2010 was more ups and downs, indicating that after returning from the serious knee injury, he was still struggling to find his consistency. He went on to participate in two Asian tournaments. He beat Sam Querrey and Michael Berrer to reach the quarterfinals of the China Open in Beijing, but lost to Djokovic. He then lost in the first round of the Shanghai Masters to Stanislas Wawrinka. After Asia, he returned to France to play Open Sud de France in Montpellier, where he reached the quarterfinals.

In December 2010, Simon was picked to play the Davis Cup final for France, which was hosted in Belgrade, Serbia. The final was filled with controversies over which player was to be called on to play each match. France called on Simon to play Novak Djokovic in day 1, while others were expecting Michaël Llodra to play, based on Llodra's good form in the BNP Paribas Masters (including beating Djokovic in two sets). Simon lost the match in three sets. When France won the doubles and led 2–1 going into day 3, the French team seemed to be on its way to yet another Davis Cup victory. But day 3 opened with Djokovic in strong form defeating Monfils in three easy sets, leaving the championship to a deciding fifth match. The schedule originally stated that the fifth match was to be played by Janko Tipsarević and Simon. Last-minute replacement saw both replaced by their teammates Viktor Troicki and Michaël Llodra respectively. The fifth match ended in anticlimactic fashion with an overwhelming victory for Troicki in three sets. Serbia won the Davis Cup for the first time in history. France's defeat caused some to question the choice of Llodra to play Troicki when Simon has a 4–0 head-to-head record against the Serb. Nevertheless, everyone agreed that Troicki and the Serbian team had displayed convincing performances over their French opponent, and the victory was well deserved. 2011: Eight & Ninth ATP titles Simon started his 2011 campaign by entering three tournaments in Australia: Brisbane, Sydney, and the 2011 Australian Open.

{"text": "The Patamona are an Amerindian people native to the Pakaraima Mountains of Guyana and northern Brazil. They speak a Cariban language, Kapóng, and have often been referred to interchangeably as Akawaio or Ingariko. Patamona are considered a sub-group of Kapon people. There are about 5,000 living members of this and closely related ethnic groups in Guyana. A 1990 population estimate for Guyana was 5500. According to FUNASA, Brazil had 120 Patamona in 2010. They were recognized as a distinct ethnic group in Brazil since 2005. History They are known archaeologically from pottery collections in the Yawong Valley and the upper Siparuni River. These collections suggest an affiliation with Akawaio groups in the 19th century. The burial urn guarded by a serpent is a characteristic artifact of Patamona pottery. Pottery was traded for cassava graters made by other Carib groups up until the 20th century. The region was exploited until recently for suitable farm lands, hunting and fishing. The Patamona were not contacted until the early 19th century. To this day, the Patamona people call themselves the People of the Heavens, whose remnants of their culture survive in Paramakatoi, as well as nearby Kaieteur Falls. Villages In Guyana, residents of Paramakatoi and some other villages are literate in English and Patamona. Other villages with Patamona populations include Campbelltown, Micobie, Monkey Mountain, Princeville, and Kato. Orinduik is a Patamona village along the Maú River. In Brazil, the Patamona have a minority presence in Raposa Serra do Sol. Culture Kaieteur Falls is an important cultural site for the Patamona people. Kaieteur Falls has been named after Old Kaie, a member of the Patamona tribe. In their animist religion the Patamona believe in Knaima, a spirit that possesses people and turns them into evil beings. Common agricultural products include bitter cassava, yam, sweet potato, sugarcane, chili pepper, squash. Bitter cassava is used to make kasiri and pajuaru. Kasiri is a lightly fermented cassava drink consumed at breakfast, while pajuaru has a longer fermentation and is a festive drink. Fish are often eaten, and can be dry smoked. Culinary practices are similar to other indigenous people of the region, including preparation of the Guyanese pepperpot, called tuma in Patamona. Food is also steamed by packaging them in leaves and setting them beside a fire. They also gather wild mushrooms for consumption, including amanita perphaea (or pulutukwe), Cookeina (agubana), Lentinula boryana (kapiokwok) and certain clavulina also known as kunmudlutse and tepurumeng.

{"text": "The Rio Grande leopard frog (Lithobates berlandieri or Rana berlandieri) is a species of aquatic frog native to the southern United States in Texas and New Mexico, and south through Mexico and Central America. It is also sometimes referred to as the Mexican leopard frog. The epithet berlandieri is in honor of the naturalist Jean Louis Berlandier, who worked for the Mexican government on one of the first biological surveys of Texas. Physical description Rio Grande leopard frogs grow from in length. They are usually tan, brown, or pale green in color, with distinctive black spotting with prominent light-colored ridges down either side of their backs. Their noses are angular, and they have long, powerful legs with webbed feet. Ecology and behavior The species is primarily aquatic, and mostly nocturnal, though they can be often found during the day resting along the edge of the water. Despite their geographic range being mostly arid or semiarid, they inhabit permanent water sources, such as streams, creeks, and ponds. They are insectivorous, but like most frogs, will eat almost anything they can overpower and swallow. Mating occurs during the rainy periods of the spring and fall. The males make a rattling call which is loud enough to be heard a quarter mile or more away. Eggs are laid in large masses attached to aquatic vegetation. Taxonomy The Rio Grande leopard frog was once considered a subspecies of the northern leopard frog, but was later recognized as a distinct species due to distinct mating call and morphological differences. Recent research has placed Rio Grande leopard frogs in the Scurrilirana species group of the subgenus Pantherana. Geographic range and status Found from Central Texas to New Mexico (where it is listed as vulnerable), south to Mexico through the Yucatán Peninsula, Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras to northeastern Nicaragua, its presence uncertain in El Salvador. It is easily confused with other species that share its range, such as the Plains leopard frog (Lithobates blairi). It is unknown whether hybridization occurs. The species has also been introduced to the Colorado River in California and Arizona, and is known to be expanding its range south into Mexico in the state of Baja California. It is believed to be contributing to the population reduction of the lowland leopard frog (Lithobates yavapaiensis), which is native to the region. This expansion of range is the primary factor in the Rio Grande leopard frog being classified as least concern, by the IUCN Red List.

{"text": "Gheorghe \"Gică\" Craioveanu (born 14 February 1968) is a Romanian retired footballer who played as a striker. He spent most of his professional career in Spain–11 years out of 18–with Real Sociedad, Villarreal and Getafe, respectively, amassing totals of 330 matches and 70 goals in both major levels combined. A Romanian international in the 1990s, Craioveanu represented the nation at the 1998 World Cup. Club career Craioveanu was born in Hunedoara, Transylvania. After playing for modest clubs, he reached Liga I in January 1991 (one month shy of his 23rd birthday) after signing with FC Universitatea Craiova. On 3 March he made his competition debut in a 0–1 away loss against FC Steaua București, but his team would eventually win the national championship with three goals from 13 appearances from the player; during his spell in Craiova, they never ranked lower than fourth and also won two domestic cups, while he was also crowned the league's top scorer in 1994 and 1995. In summer 1995, after a combined 49 goals in his last two seasons at Universitatea, Craioveanu joined La Liga side Real Sociedad, netting 11 times in his first season to help the Basques finish in seventh position. Two years later he moved to Villarreal CF which were having their first top-tier experience, scoring a career-best – in Spain – 13 goals as they were immediately relegated. Craioveanu was again a very important attacking unit – 38 games, eight goals – as Villarreal promoted the year after and, already a veteran, helped to the club's domestic consolidation. In 2002 the 34-year-old signed with Getafe CF of the second level, scoring 16 goals in 120 appearances over the course of four seasons and helping the Madrid team achieve a first ever top-flight promotion in his second year; he retired in June 2006, having appeared in 459 league matches during his professional career and scored a total of 131 goals. International career Craioveanu earned 25 caps for Romania, his debut coming on 8 September 1993 in a 4–0 win in the Faroe Islands for the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. His only major tournament was the 1998 World Cup in France, where his output consisted of 33 minutes in the round of 16 0–1 defeat to Croatia. International stats Scores and results list Romania's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Craioveanu goal. Post-retirement After retiring, Craioveanu settled in Getafe (the city of his last club) in Madrid's metropolitan area. During the local elections of 2007 he won a sports adviser seat on the local council, running as an independent with backing from the People's Party; this was the first suffrage during which Romanian citizens were eligible in other European Union counties, following Romania's European integration. On 16 June 2007, as a result of a local alliance between the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party and Izquierda Unida, which took away PP's control over the Sports Adviser seat, Craioveanu convened with the PP not to hold a political office, and resigned from the council. He also worked as a co-presenter in La Sexta's football programme Minuto y Resultado, and a radio commentator on Onda Cero; after his first marriage ended in divorce, he remarried with a Spanish woman named Gemma, and eventually fathered two children, one from each union. Personal life Craioveanu's son, Alejandro, played youth football for Castellón de la Plana-based CD Drac as well as Villarreal.

{"text": "Caorle (; ) is a coastal town in the Metropolitan City of Venice, Veneto, northern Italy, located between the estuaries of the Livenza and Lemene rivers. It is situated on the Adriatic Sea between two other tourist towns, Eraclea and Bibione. History The ancient name of the city was Caprulae (possibly because of the wild goats that grazed in this area, or in honour of pagan goddess Capris); Caorle was founded in the 1st century BC by Romans. Many archeological findings confirm this attribution, for instance the sacrificial altar called Ara Licovia (Licovian Altar, from the Roman Licovi family), today housed in the cathedral. A safe zone between the estuaries of the Livenza (Latin: Liquentia) and Lemene (Latin: Romantinum) rivers, Caorle gained importance when people from Concordia Sagittaria arrived as refugees during the Barbarian Invasions. In that period a Paleo-Christian church was built, some remains of which are today kept in the cathedral's museum. In the 11th century the cathedral was built, which still stands today. It was once the seat of a bishopric. During the following centuries, Caorle became one of the nine important cities of the Republic of Venice; evidence to that effect are the many Istrian flagstones which compose some monuments in the city, and also the ancient structure of the city with bridge and canals, like a little Venice. At the end of the Republic of Venice, with the Napoleonic invasions, Caorle went into decline; the last diocesan bishop of the diocese was moved in 1807 to Chioggia and the territory of the diocese was attached in 1818 to the Patriarchate of Venice. No longer a residential bishopric, Caorle/Caprulae is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see. Caorle was an important strategic location during World War I, until the Italian Army started its counteroffensive from the Piave. Territory Since the beginning of the 20th century the territory around Caorle has been deeply modified. Most of the woods of the \"Selva Lupanica\" were cut to give room to fields for cultivation, rivers were embanked, and marshes were reclaimed. This brought a landscape of wide flat areas, with no trees even along the rivers course. Along the coast, sedimentation and erosion constantly modify the scenery. The landscape is still rather wild, with changing sandbanks and the fishing valleys. Main sights Cathedral The Cathedral of St. Stephen was built in 1038, an example of Romanesque and of the Byzantine-Ravennate style. Its façade is simple; near the central door there are two bas-reliefs (St. Agatonicus on the left, St. William on the right); the interior is organized with a nave and two side aisles, divided by pillars and columns which support semi-circular arches, and it has a truss-beam roof. It contains many masterpieces of the Venetian school of art, the most important of which is The Last Supper, painted by Gregorio Lazzarini (master of famous painter Tiepolo). The central apse has the remains of a 17th-century fresco; above the see there is the \"Pala d'oro\" (golden altar-piece), given by the queen Catherine Cornaro when, after a shipwreck, she found refuge in the Caprulan coasts. It is made up of a set of six panels, two for the Annunciation (Archangel Gabriel and Blessed Virgin Mary) and the other four for the prophets and Christ. From the roof, a 15th-century crucifix hangs above the modern high altar (the ancient one was sold along with many others; only four altars remain today). Outside, the characteristic bell tower, dating to 1048, rises to a height of 48 meters. It is a typical example of Romanesque style, but it has a cylindrical structure, and it is surmounted by a cone-shaped cusp, that makes it unique in the world. The cathedral owns a liturgical museum, inaugurated on September 13, 1975 by Patriarch Albino Luciani (future Pope John Paul I) in the old bishops' chapel; it keep vestments, altar cloths and holy vessels of the Caprulan bishops, and of the Pope John XXIII, who was very attached to Caorle since he was also Patriarch of Venice. When he became Pope, his servants were two Caprulan brothers. In the museum, there are also a precious silver \"Capitular Cross\", six icons of the apostles (which formed the ancient iconostasis), painted by Venetian school of art in the 12th - 13th centuries, and a silver-gold reliquary, said of \"the most precious Blood\", which, according to tradition, contains some of the ground on which the bleeding Jesus Christ passed before he was crucified. Another important piece of the museum is the St Stephen reliquary, which contains the skull of Saint Stephen, Patron of Caorle. Church of the Blessed Virgin of the Angel The Church of Blessed Virgin of the Angel is built on a little promontory on the sea. In ancient times, the church had three naves, but the sea repeatedly destroyed one of them, so in the 18th century the church was rebuilt, with the structure that it has today. The legend says that one day a number of fishermen saw a light on the sea; when they approached it, they found a statue of the Virgin Mary with the Child, and they carried it ashore. The bishop and the townspeople tried to carry the statue to the cathedral but it was very heavy; so the bishop called a group of children who, because of their innocence, succeeded in carrying it to the nearby church of Archangel Michael (for reason called the \"Virgin of the Angel\"). Devotion to the \"Virgin of the sea\" is very important to the Caprulans; to her are dedicated two festivals, the annual Feast of Incoronation, during which takes place the traditional \"fire of the bell tower\", with fireworks, and the Feast of the Virgin of the Angel which, in accordance with the wishes of Pope John XXIII, takes place every five years. Being the church at the end of the waterfront promenade, its bell tower is used as a lighthouse. Tourism Caorle is a small city, but is frequented by tourists in all seasons. The old town centre is still structured as a little Venetian corner, with its coloured houses, its \"calli\" (alleys) and \"campielli\" (squares). During the summer many family-oriented activities take place on its long beach. Others are organized in its lagoon (an example of Venetian lagoon), where many characteristic traditional \"casoni\" (the huts where fishermen lived in the winter while fishing) still stand. Notable people Recently, the city of Caorle gave honorary citizenship to Rigoberta Menchú Tum (Nobel Peace Prize) and to Cardinal Angelo Scola, Patriarch of Venice.

{"text": "The Caribou, colloquially referred to as The Newfie Bullet, was a passenger train operated by Canadian National Railways (CNR) on the island of Newfoundland. History The Dominion of Newfoundland became the 10th province of Canada when it entered Confederation on March 31, 1949. At that time, CNR took over the operations of the Newfoundland Railway, a narrow gauge railway network running across the island. At the time that CNR took over operations, the premiere cross-island passenger train was called The Overland Limited. CNR renamed this train in 1950 to the Caribou and it maintained approximately the same 23-hour schedule from St. John's (also the eastern terminus of the railway on Newfoundland), to the system's western terminus at the ferry terminal in Port aux Basques, where connecting ferry services to the North American railway network at North Sydney, Nova Scotia, were made. The 23 hour schedule sealed the fate of the Caribou when the Trans-Canada Highway opened across the island in 1965, allowing automobiles to travel between Port aux Basques and St. John's in under 12 hours. CN withdrew the dedicated passenger trains in July 1969 and instituted a bus service, marketed under the name \"Road Cruiser.\" CN maintained limited \"mixed\" passenger and freight train service to certain isolated communities on the island until the complete abandonment of its narrow gauge system in the fall of 1988. The CN Roadcruiser Bus service operated until March 29, 1996, when it was sold to DRL Coachlines of Triton, Newfoundland.

History The college was founded as a women's teacher training college in 1892 by followers of Friedrich Fröbel. The Froebel Society had been formed in 1874 and in 1892 Julia Salis Schwabe led an initiative to found a college for training teachers. It was imperative that the trainee teachers should be allowed to practice whilst they were learning so a school/nursery was established in parallel. The college became co-educational in 1965. Emilie Michaelis (1834–1904) was the First Principal of Froebel College serving from 1892 until 1901. She was succeeded by Esther Lawrence (1862–1944) who led for over 30 years finishing in 1932. The third Principal was Eglantyne Mary Jebb MA (1889–1978) who led until 1955 when she was replaced by her friend Molly Brearley. Brearley created courses where teachers could gain diplomas and the college became involved in cross-curricular Bachelor of Education courses. In their first year, students would learn about child development, while simultaneously learning about subjects like maths and science. The college's ideas were contained in, Fundamentals in the First School, which was a book that Brearley and Raymond Bott edited and published in 1969. Brearley retired in 1970.

{"text": "Jean-Laurent-Frederick Longuet (5 October 1876 – 11 September 1938) was a French socialist politician and journalist. He was Karl Marx's grandson. Early years Jean, often called 'Johnny' as a boy by his family, was born in London on October 5, 1876, the son of Charles and Jenny Longuet. He was their second son, and the eldest who survived to adulthood. The family often visited Jenny's father, Karl Marx, who liked to play with his grandchildren. The Longuet family moved to France in February 1881. In summer 1882 Karl Marx stayed with the Longuets for three months, being joined by Jean's aunt Eleanor Marx. By this time Jenny was suffering from bladder cancer, and would die a year later. To ease the burden on the family, Eleanor took Jean back to England in August 1882, promising to educate and discipline him. They became close, with Eleanor thinking of him as ‘my boy’. On his return to France, Jean lived for a time with his father's family in Caen to continue his studies. Political career After attending university in Paris, Longuet worked as a journalist and trained as a lawyer. He worked for the newspaper L'Humanité and was a founder and editor of the newspaper Le Populaire. He was active in one of France's principal socialist parties, the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), and served both as a mayor and as a member of the French Chamber of Deputies. During the First World War, he was a pacifist but also supported war credits. At the Strasbourg Congress in 1918 his policy was adopted by the majority of the socialist SFIO. After the Tours Congress of 1920 had the Communists gained the majority, he supported the minority and joined the centrist Two-and-a-half International, the Vienna Union. He criticised the League Against Imperialism, which was created in 1927 and supported by the Comintern. Longuet supported pro-Zionist positions at the Socialist International meeting in Brussels in 1930 and at a speech to a Zionist group in Paris in 1935. He also represented Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, a political prisoner, who while being taken from Bombay to England to stand trial on the charges of sedition and abetment of murder, escaped from the ship, which was docked at Marseilles, and swam ashore until he was caught by a French gendarme. The case drew criticism from the French socialist press, which decried that the individual rights of Savarkar had been trampled as a result of his arrest by British constables on French soil, which they believed to violate the sovereignty of France. Pressure from the leftist and liberal press continued and forced both countries in October 1910 to take their case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. Madam Cama, a revolutionary Parsi woman from Bombay who was one of the founders of the Paris Indian Society, managed to get power of attorney, which facilitated the engagement of Longuet as Savarkar's representative in The Hague. However, as the arbitration was between France and Britain, the tribunal did not accept Longuet's memorandum on behalf of Savarkar, considering it out of the terms of reference. However, Longuet persisted and personally handed over the copies of the memorandum to the members of the court. Death and family Jean Longuet married Anita Desvaux (1875–1960) in 1900. They had two sons: the lawyer and journalist Robert-Jean Longuet (1901–1987) and the sculptor Karl-Jean Longuet (1904–1981). Jean's younger brother Edgar Longuet, a physician, was also an active socialist. Longuet died at the Aix-les-Bains Clinic after a car accident in September 1938, aged 61.

{"text": "Jenny Caroline Marx Longuet (1 May 1844 – 11 January 1883) was the eldest daughter of Jenny von Westphalen Marx and Karl Marx. Briefly a political journalist writing under the pen name J. Williams, Longuet taught language classes and had a family of five sons and a daughter before her death to cancer at the age of 38. Biography Early years Jenny Caroline Marx, known to family and close friends as \"Jennychen\" to distinguish her from her mother, was born in Paris on 1 May 1844, the oldest daughter of Karl Marx and Jenny von Westphalen Marx. She was a fragile child but was nevertheless the first of the Marx children to survive childhood. In 1868, at the age of 24, she accepted a position as a French language teacher in order to help her parents financially. She also contributed a number of articles to the socialist press, in 1870 writing under the pen name \"J. Williams\" on the treatment of the Irish political prisoners by the British government. She met her future husband, the French journalist and radical political activist Charles Longuet in 1871. The pair became engaged in March 1872 and were married on 10 October the same year in a civil ceremony at St Pancras registry office, she taking the name Jenny Longuet. As with her parents, the young couple faced economic hardship in their earliest years. They moved to Oxford soon after their marriage, hoping that Charles could find work as a teacher, but he was unable to do so. Jenny earned a meagre income for the pair working as a private tutor, giving lessons in French, German, and singing. The couple's financial lives became more stable in 1874, when Jenny and Charles found work as teachers, with Jenny holding a position as a German teacher at the St Clement Danes School. The minimal salary she earned at the school was supplemented by giving private lessons. Her husband obtained a position teaching French at King's College, together making enough to maintain a small house in London. Jenny Longuet was pregnant in almost every year of her married life. She gave birth to a first son in September 1873, but the child died the following summer of diarrhea. A second son, Jean Laurent Frederick \"Johnny\" Longuet (1876–1938) fared better, surviving to eventually become a leader of the Socialist Party of France. A third son, born in 1878, mentally challenged and sickly, died at the age of 5, while a fourth, Edgar \"Wolf\" Longuet (1879–1950) lived a full life, becoming a medical doctor as well as an activist in the French Socialist Party. Return to France A political amnesty granted by the government of France in July 1880 allowed Charles Longuet the opportunity to return to his native country and he was quick to return, taking a position as an editor of La Justice, a radical daily newspaper founded by Georges Clemenceau. By this time, however, Jenny had begun to suffer from cancer and she for a time remained in London with her three sons, to be near her aging parents. In February 1881 Jenny and the boys moved to France to join her husband. The family settled in the town of Argenteuil, near Paris, where they were regularly visited by the boys' doting grandfather Karl Marx. Despite her ill health, Jenny delivered another son, Marcel Longuet (1881-1949) who later worked as a journalist, including for the Parisian newspaper L'Aurore. A final child, a daughter also named Jenny Longuet, was born in September 1882 and lived until 1952. Death and legacy Just four months after the birth of her daughter, Longuet died at Argenteuil on 11 January 1883, at the age of 38, probably from cancer of the bladder, a condition which had afflicted her for some time. Her father was too ill to attend the funeral in France; he died two months later.

{"text": "The Spoilers is a 1930 American Pre-Code Western film directed by Edwin Carewe and starring Gary Cooper, Kay Johnson, and Betty Compson. Set in Nome, Alaska during the 1898 Gold Rush, the film is about a gold prospector and a corrupt Alaska politician who fight for control over a gold mine. The film features a spectacular saloon fistfight between Cooper and William \"Stage\" Boyd. The Spoilers was adapted to screen by Bartlett Cormack from the 1906 Rex Beach novel of the same name. Film versions also appeared in 1914, 1923, 1942, and 1955. Plot While traveling to Nome, Alaska, Roy Glenister (Gary Cooper) meets beautiful Helen Chester (Kay Johnson), who soon becomes his sweetheart. Glenister is one of several owners of a lucrative mine called The Midas. When he arrives in Nome, he discovers that his partners, Slapjack Simms (Slim Summerville) and Joe Dextry (James Kirkwood), are in the middle of a legal dispute with three corrupt officials: United States Marshal Voorhees (Jack Holmes), Judge Stillman (Lloyd Ingraham), and a politician named Alec McNamara (William \"Stage\" Boyd ). They have been engaged in a racket claiming titles to various mines, ejecting the miners, and then making McNamara owner of the disputed properties. The three corrupt officials lay claim to The Midas. McNamara also steals money from Glenister, Dextry, and Slapjack, preventing them from enlisting legal help from the United States. When Dextry and Glenister plan a vigilante action, McNamara calls in a detail of soldiers to protect \"his property\". As Glenister and McNamara prepare for a gunfight, they are dissuaded by Helen, who suggests that the courts handle the dispute. Later, after jealous saloon owner Cherry Malotte (Betty Compson) lies to Glennister telling him that Helen and McNamara are conspiring to cheat him again, Glennister and McNamara settle their differences with a spectacular fistfight, with McNamara getting the worst. Afterwards, Glenister wins the hand of Helen.

French as Man in Bar Jack Holmes as Voorhees John Beck as Hanson Production The Spoilers was filmed on location in Oregon. Reception In his review for The New York Times, Mordaunt Hall gave the film a negative review for its poor narrative, unconvincing plot, and \"absurdly melodramatic dialogue\". Believing that the film would have benefitted from more details of the working for gold and fewer scenes in gambling halls and other places, Hall continued: Finally, Hall criticized the film's \"general lack of intelligence\" and the narrative, which \"runs from one scene to another with too much threatening talk and an ineffectual misunderstanding between Glenister and Helen Chester, who are in love with each other.\" References External links 1930 films Films directed by Edwin Carewe 1930s English-language films Films based on American novels 1930 Western (genre) films Paramount Pictures films Films based on Western (genre) novels Films set in Alaska American black-and-white films American Western (genre) films Films based on The Spoilers (Beach novel) Remakes of American films Sound film remakes of silent films 1930s American films"}
{"text": "A Block and bleed manifold is a hydraulic manifold that combines one or more block/isolate valves, usually ball valves, and one or more bleed/vent valves, usually ball or needle valves, into one component for interface with other components (pressure measurement transmitters, gauges, switches, etc.) of a hydraulic (fluid) system. The purpose of the block and bleed manifold is to isolate or block the flow of fluid in the system so the fluid from upstream of the manifold does not reach other components of the system that are downstream. Then they bleed off or vent the remaining fluid from the system on the downstream side of the manifold. For example, a block and bleed manifold would be used to stop the flow of fluids to some component, then vent the fluid from that component’s side of the manifold, in order to effect some kind of work (maintenance/repair/replacement) on that component. Types of valves Block and Bleed A block and bleed manifold with one block valve and one bleed valve is also known as an isolation valve or block and bleed valve; a block and bleed manifold with multiple valves is also known as an isolation manifold. This valve is used in combustible gas trains in many industrial applications. Block and bleed needle valves are used in hydraulic and pneumatic systems because the needle valve allows for precise flow regulation when there is low flow in a non-hazardous environment. Double Block and Bleed (DBB Valves) These valves replace existing traditional techniques employed by pipeline engineers to generate a double block and bleed configuration in the pipeline. Two block valves and a bleed valve are as a unit, or manifold, to be installed for positive isolation. Used for critical process service, DBB valves are for high pressure systems or toxic/hazardous fluid processes. Applications that use DBB valves include instrument drain, chemical injection connection, chemical seal isolation, and gauge isolation. DBB valves do the work of three separate valves (2 isolations and 1 drain) and require less space and have less weight. Cartridge Type Standard Length DBB This type of Double Block and Bleed Valves have a patented design which incorporates two ball valves and a bleed valve into one compact cartridge type unit with ANSI B16.5 tapped flanged connections. The major benefit of this design configuration is that the valve has the same face-to-face dimension as a single block ball valve (as specified in API 6D and ANSI B16.10), which means the valve can easily be installed into an existing pipeline without the need for any pipeline re-working. Three Piece Non Standard Length DBB This type of Double Block and Bleed Valves (DBB Valves) feature the traditional style of flange-by-flange type valve and is available with ANSI B16.5 flanges, hub connections and welded ends to suit the pipeline system it is to be installed in. It features all the benefits of the single unit DBB valve, with the added benefit of a bespoke face-to-face dimension if required. Single Unit DBB This design also has operational advantages, there are significantly fewer potential leak paths within the double block and bleed section of the pipeline. Because the valves are full bore with an uninterrupted flow orifice they have got a negligible pressure drop across the unit. The pipelines where these valves are installed can also be pigged without any problems. There are several advantages in using a Double Block and Bleed Valve. Significantly, because all the valve components are housed in a single unit, the space required for the installation is dramatically reduced thus freeing up room for other pieces of essential equipment. Considering the operations and procedures executed before an operator can intervene, the Double Block and Bleed manifold offers further advantages over the traditional hook up. Due to the volume of the cavity between the two balls being so small, the operator is afforded the opportunity to evacuate this space efficiently thereby quickly establishing a safe working environment.

{"text": "Erythema annulare centrifugum (EAC), is a descriptive term for a class of skin lesion presenting redness (erythema) in a ring form (anulare) that spreads from a center (centrifugum). It was first described by Darier in 1916. Many different terms have been used to classify these types of lesions and it is still controversial on what exactly defines EAC. Some of the types include annular erythema (deep and superficial), erythema perstans, erythema gyratum perstans, erythema gyratum repens, darier erythema (deep gyrate erythema) and erythema figuratum perstans. Symptoms Occurring at any age these lesions appear as raised pink-red ring or bulls-eye marks. They range in size from . The lesions sometimes increase size and spread over time and may not be complete rings but irregular shapes. Distribution is usually on the thighs and legs but can also appear on the upper extremities, areas not exposed to sunlight, trunk or face. Currently EAC is not known to be contagious, but as many cases are incorrectly diagnosed as EAC, it is difficult to be certain. Causes Often no specific cause for the eruptions is found. However, it is sometimes linked to underlying diseases and conditions such as: Food (including blue cheese or tomatoes). Contact Dermatitis (i.e. cleaning agents, fabric softeners, etc.) Fungal, Bacterial and Viral infections such as sinusitis, tuberculosis, candidiasis or tinea. Drugs including finasteride, etizolam (and benzodiazepines), chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, oestrogen, penicillin and amitriptyline. Cancer (especially the type known as erythema gyratum perstans, in which there are concentric and whirling rings). Primary biliary cirrhosis. Graves disease. Appendicitis. Lupus Pregnancy (EAC usually disappears/stops soon after delivery of baby). Hormone (Contraceptive Pill, Stress, Hormone Drugs) Lyme disease Diagnosis A skin biopsy can be performed to test for EAC; tests should be performed to rule out other possible diseases such as: pityriasis rosea, tinea corporis, psoriasis, nummular eczema, atopic dermatitis, drug reaction, erythema migrans and other rashes. Differential diagnosis Sarcoidosis Fungal infection Lupus erythematosus Treatment No treatment is usually needed as they usually go away anywhere from months to years. The lesions may last from anywhere between 4 weeks to 34 years with an average duration of 11 months. If caused by an underlying disease or malignancy, then treating and removing the disease or malignancy will stop the lesions. It usually doesn't require treatment, but topical corticosteroids may be helpful in reducing redness, swelling and itchiness. Some supported and not supported methods of having an effect on EAC include: Photosensitive so it can be moved/reduced with appropriate sunlight. Vitamin D Immune system - hence it will increase in size/number when the immune system is low or overloaded. Hormone Drugs Disulone Stress reduction Topical calcipotriol - a topical vitamin D derivative has been known to be beneficial Epidemiology It is very rare and estimated to affect 1 in 100,000 per year. Because of its rarity the documentation, cases and information are sparse and not a huge amount is known for certain, meaning that EAC could actually be a set of many un-classified skin lesions. It is known to occur at all ages and all genders equally. Some articles state that women are more likely to be affected than men.

{"text": "The Tours Congress was the 18th National Congress of the French Section of the Workers' International, or SFIO, which took place in Tours on 25–30 December 1920. During the Congress, the majority voted to join the Third International and create the French Section of the Communist International, which became the French Communist Party in 1921. The SFIO divided itself in three factions during the Congress: The larger one gathered those who had accepted the Third International's 21 Conditions behind Fernand Loriot, Boris Souvarine, Ludovic Frossard, and Marcel Cachin. They did not, however, accept all of Lenin's conditions, and no vote on the matter took place. This left-wing faction, formed by the younger leaders of the party and most of the SFIO's members, obtained three-quarters of the votes and split away to form the French Section of the Communist International (Section Française de l'Internationale Communiste, or SFIC). They took with them the party paper L'Humanité, founded by Jean Jaurès in 1904. L'Humanité remained tied to the party until the 1990s. The second faction was led by a minority who accepted the adhesion to the Third International, but only under specific conditions. They finally allied themselves to the third faction. The third faction led by Léon Blum and most elected socialists (including Paul Faure and Jean Longuet), who completely refused Lenin's conditions and preferred staying inside of the Second International. Blum, who would become Prime Minister during the 1936–1938 Popular Front, famously declared: \"Someone has to stay and keep the old house.\" Hence the SFIO split in two: the SFIC (3,208 votes) and the SFIO (1,022 votes). The next year, the CGT trade-union also split, with the creation of the Communist Confédération générale du travail unitaire (CGTU), which itself merged again with the CGT at the 1936 Toulouse Congress during the Popular Front. A young Ho Chi Minh, then known as Nguyen Ai Quoc, was present at the congress and made a speech decrying the exploitation of the French colonies, and supporting the proposal to join the Third International.

After retiring in 2011, he went on to manage River Plate, Banfield, Guadalajara, San Jose Earthquakes and AEK Athens. Playing career Club Born in Azul, Buenos Aires Province, Almeyda started playing professionally for local and national powerhouse River Plate, first as understudy to Leonardo Astrada then as a starter, helping the side to the 1996 Primera División title after his insertion in the starting XI, as well as that year's Copa Libertadores. Shortly after, he moved to Sevilla in Spain, for a record fee for a player in the country of $9 million; he appeared regularly in his first and only season with the Andalusians, but suffered La Liga relegation. Almeyda played in the Italian Serie A in the following eight years, successively representing Lazio, Parma and Inter Milan. He spent three seasons in Rome with Lazio, becoming a firm fan favourite especially after scoring a 35-yard goal against Parma's Gianluigi Buffon, his only of the 1999–2000 campaign, which ended with league and Coppa Italia conquest. Additionally, he was voted the competition's best player in 1998–99, and also won – as a starter – the last UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, against Mallorca, and was often partnered with compatriot Juan Sebastián Verón in the heart of midfield by manager Sven-Göran Eriksson in his 4–4–2 formation, with Verón providing the creativity and Almeyda the strength. In the summer of 2002, Almeyda was exchanged with Vratislav Greško and moved to Inter, where he was again partnered by compatriots as in his previous clubs. Two years later, he joined his final team in Italy, lowly Brescia, on a free transfer. The following year, after the team's relegation as second from bottom, he returned to Argentina and agreed to play for Quilmes, which appeared at the Libertadores, announcing his retirement after their elimination from that tournament. After one and a half years away from football, in which he represented Argentina in a Showball tour around the world alongside Diego Maradona and participated in the Indoor Football World Cup in Spain, Almeyda joined Norwegian Premier League side Lyn in Oslo, in which he was accompanied by compatriot José Oscar Flores; their friend Terje Liverod was central in these transfers. The midfielder made his debut on 13 May 2007, but only played regularly in the reserves and in the domestic cup, being released as the striker shortly after and again retiring from football. On 16 January 2009, at almost 36, Almeyda, after nearly agreeing on a return to River, signed with modest Fénix in the fourth division. During his brief spell, he managed to be sent off on two occasions. On 19 August 2009, veteran Almeyda finally re-joined his main club River Plate, teaming up with former teammates Marcelo Gallardo and Ariel Ortega. In June 2011, the team was relegated to the second level for the first time in their history and he retired from football, being appointed team manager the following month. International Almeyda won 35 caps for Argentina over the course of seven years, his debut coming in April 1996 against Bolivia. Shortly after, he helped the Olympic side to the silver medal at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Subsequently, Almeyda was picked in the squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. He started in all five games during the tournament, as the country reached the quarter–finals. After Marcelo Bielsa became Argentina's manager, Almeyda did not get as much playing time. He was, however, selected for the 2002 World Cup which was held in South Korea and Japan, and played in the 1–1 group stage draw against Sweden. Managerial career River Plate Almeyda spent 18 months in charge at River Plate, winning the Primera B Nacional and earning promotion back to the top division at the end of the 2011–12 season. He left the club in November 2012. Banfield In early April 2013, Almeyda signed with Banfield in the Argentine second level. During his spell, he won the league title, once again to be subsequently promoted. Guadalajara On 15 September 2015, Almeyda was appointed manager at Guadalajara of the Mexican Liga MX, proclaiming he wanted to \"awaken the giant.\" He won his first four matches in charge, including one against rivals Club América on 26 September by a score of 2–1 at the Estadio Azteca. On 4 November 2015, after nine years of a title hiatus, Almeyda's team won the Copa MX after defeating Club León by a score of 1–0. On 10 July 2016, they played their first ever Supercopa MX and won their second trophy in under a year by besting C.D. Veracruz 2–0, and as a result qualified to the Libertadores for the first time since 2012, but ultimately did not participate as a result of scheduling conflicts. On 19 April 2017, Almeyda led Chivas to their fourth Copa MX title, defeating Monarcas Morelia in a penalty shootout after a 0–0 draw. After placing third overall in the Clausura's general table, the final second leg was played at the Estadio Chivas on 28 May 2017 and the hosts won their 12th title in the competition after besting Tigres UANL by an aggregate of 4–3; thus, they became the first team in Mexican history to win the double in a single season on two occasions. Almeyda won the 2018 edition of the CONCACAF Champions League with the club, and as a result qualified for that year's FIFA Club World Cup. On 11 June 2018, however, he left, citing differences with an executive. San Jose Earthquakes On 8 October 2018, Almeyda was appointed as the new head coach of Major League Soccer club San Jose Earthquakes, starting with the 2019 season. He attained 44 points within the Western Conference, missing the playoff berth by one win. The following campaign, Almeyda's side managed to reach the playoffs, facing Sporting Kansas City in the first round but losing following a 3–0 penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 tie. On 18 April 2022, Almeyda and San Jose Earthquakes parted ways, two days after the team drew 2–2 with Nashville SC. AEK Athens On 20 May 2022, Almeyda signed a two-year contract with Greek Super League club AEK Athens. The contract includes a one-year renewal option, subject to performance satisfaction. On 10 January 2023, Almeyda renewed his contract with AEK until 2028. Almeyda went on to win the 2022–23 Super League Greece five points ahead of second place Panathinaikos and win the Greek Cup over PAOK in his debut season, giving AEK Athens their first double since 1978. Next year, Matias Almeyda led AEK Athens to the Europa league group stage (Three years after the last european presence in a group stage for AEK). Style of play A tenacious, dynamic and physically strong player in spite of his diminutive stature, Almeyda excelled in a midfield holding role due to his stamina, tactical awareness, reactions, anticipation and work rate, as well as his ability to press opponents and break down opposition plays which allowed him to protect his team's back-line. Although he earned a reputation in the media as a hard tackler, he was gifted with good feet and passing ability, which enabled him to start attacking plays after winning back possession; he also stood out for his leadership throughout his career.

His home was on the Whiterock Road opposite Belfast City Cemetery. He attended St. Kevin's Primary School and then St. Thomas's Secondary School near Ballymurphy. At the latter school the headteacher was the writer Michael McLaverty. Many years later Hamill recalled his teaching: \"Over and over again he explained the precise word, the need for feeling in the poetry. There would be no Sons And Lovers without feeling – the reading public would know it was fraudulent. The preachments were gentle but firm, reasonableness in all things.\" Another one of his teachers at the school was Seamus Heaney. After finishing school, he worked for several years in England. He recalled: \"A lot of my time was spent between the bookshops at Tottenham Court Road and Charing Cross at lunchtimes.\" He then returned to Northern Ireland to study for a degree in English at the New University of Ulster. One of his lecturers was the critic Walter Allen. His fellow students included the poet Gerald Dawe and the writer Brian Keenan. After he graduated he subsequently worked for several years as a teacher in Kilcullen, County Kildare and later in Belfast. Work He has published two poetry chapbooks - the first Emigrant Brother and the second Alameda Park. His poetry has been published in a wide range of newspapers and magazines including Phoenix, Belfast Telegraph, Irish Times and the Irish Press, included in anthologies and read on both the BBC and RTÉ. His critical work has been published in various magazines including Fortnight. He was very enthusiastic about promoting the work of the poet Padraic Fiacc.

{"text": "The Spoilers is a 1955 American Western film directed by Jesse Hibbs and starring Anne Baxter, Jeff Chandler and Rory Calhoun. Set in Nome, Alaska during the 1898 Gold Rush, it culminates in a spectacular saloon fistfight between Glennister (Chandler) and McNamara (Calhoun). Film versions also appeared in 1914, 1923 (with Noah Beery, Sr. as McNamara), 1930 (with Gary Cooper as Glennister and Betty Compson as Malotte), and 1942 (with John Wayne as Glennister, Betty Compson lookalike Marlene Dietrich as Malotte, and Randolph Scott as McNamara). The 1930 and 1942 versions were the only instances of Gary Cooper and John Wayne playing the same role in the same story in two different films; Jeff Chandler portrays the part in this version. Plot Struggling miners Flapjack and Banty go to the office of Alex McNamara, the new gold commissioner in Nome, Alaska, to complain about claim jumpers. He isn't there, so they drown their sorrows at Cherry Malotte's gambling house and saloon. Cherry looks ready to steal the men's claim herself in Alex's office when he suddenly appears. He assures her Judge Stillman is on his way to Nome to review all legal matters regarding the mines. When a ship arrives bringing her sweetheart Roy Glennister back to town, Cherry runs out eagerly to meet it, to the jealousy of Blackie, her croupier. To her anger, Roy is traveling with an attractive stranger, Helen Chester. An irate Cherry leaves in a huff with Roy's co-owner of a nearby mine, Dextry. Roy insists he still loves Cherry, but she slaps his face. Alex and the newly arrived Judge Stillman set out to survey and inspect Roy's mine, insisting it will take weeks before any claims can be settled. Roy is shocked to observe that Alex, the Judge and Helen are all conspirators to steal the miners' claims. Blackie shoots the town marshal and makes sure Roy is blamed and arrested for it. A jailbreak is arranged, but Cherry rushes to warn Roy of what she has learned from Helen, that as soon as he escapes, Alex is planning to ambush Roy and make it look like a lawful shooting. A shootout between Alex and the miners ensues. Blackie dies, but not before confessing to the sheriff's murder, while Roy and Alex end up in a knockdown, drag-out fistfight. Cherry and Roy ultimately end up happily in love and in legal possession of the mine.

{"text": "The Burndy Library was one of the world's largest collections of books on the history of science and technology. It was disestablished in 2006 and its collections transferred to the Huntington Library. History Founded in 1941 in Norwalk, Connecticut by the electrical engineer, industrialist, and historian Bern Dibner, the library holdings include important scientific literature from antiquity to the 20th century. Highlights of the collection include one of the world's most complete sets of the works of Isaac Newton, including books owned and annotated by Newton, as well as some sixty manuscripts by Newton, multiple books about Leonardo da Vinci, all of Darwin's works, and important manuscript and print materials by Louis Pasteur, a 1544 edition of Archimedes' mathematical text Philosophi ac Geometrae and many important original works from the 18th and 19th centuries. Generally, the collection's strengths are in the early modern period, and include strong holdings in the history of mathematics, astronomy, and color theory. The \"Burndy\" appellation was invented by Dibner and represents a portmanteau or blend of his first and last names. The library was originally located at the Burndy Engineering Company in Norwalk, Connecticut. In 1974 Dibner donated one-quarter of the library holdings to the Smithsonian Institution to form the nucleus of its research library in the history of science and technology. In 1976, the Dibner Library of the History of Science and Technology opened at the Smithsonian Institution, and it remains part of the Smithsonian Institution Libraries housed at the National Museum of American History, Behring Center in Washington, DC. The remainder of the Burndy Library collection remained in Norwalk until after Bern Dibner's death in 1988. It was moved to the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1992 with the establishment of the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology. After residing there for more than a decade, the collection needed to be moved due to the pending demolition of the building which housed it. In November 2006, 67,000 volumes of the Burndy Library (47,000 rare books and 20,000 reference books), along with several hundred small manuscript collections and a collection of artwork and objects, were transferred to the Huntington Library in San Marino, California as a gift of the Dibner family and the Dibner Fund. The library offers a number of history of science fellowships, a lecture series and an annual conference. It is one of the Huntington's most heavily used collections, and continues to grow and expand through the Huntington's multi-faceted approach to collection use, conservation and management.

{"text": "The Cascade Caverns salamander (Eurycea latitans), or Cascade Caverns neotenic salamander, is a species of aquatic salamander endemic to Cascade Caverns in Kendall County, Texas. Like other species of cave salamanders, they are almost entirely subterranean, living in spring waters deep in limestone rock strata, so gauging the exact extent of their geographic range or even their population numbers is virtually impossible. This also leads to reduced sampling for study, which has led to some uncertainty in the taxonomic classification; some sources consider all species of Texas cave salamanders to be subspecies of the Texas salamander. Eurycea neotenes and Eurycea rathbuni also live in caves and eat small insects and spiders. Description The Cascade Caverns salamander is translucent, with a faint net-shaped pattern that is brown in color, often with white speckling. The species is rarely seen, so the amount of variation in their coloration is unknown. They are neotenic, meaning they retain characteristics into adulthood that are usually associated with juvenile salamanders, such as external gills. They have stout bodies, with short legs, and reduced eyes set under a layer of skin. This species of salamanders is threatened and could become endangered. References Chippindale, P.T., A.H.

{"text": "Mario Armando Lavandeira Jr. (born March 23, 1978), known professionally as Perez Hilton, is an American blogger, columnist, and media personality. His blog is known for posts covering gossip items about celebrities, and for posting tabloid photos over which he has added his own captions or \"doodles\". His blog has garnered controversy for its attitude, its former practice of outing alleged closeted celebrities, and its role in the increasing coverage of celebrities in all forms of media. In addition to his blogging, Hilton has written four books, hosts a podcast with Chris Booker, runs two YouTube channels, has appeared in various films and television shows, and has acted in two off-Broadway shows. In 2018, he was dubbed \"the original celebrity social media influencer\" by BroadwayWorld. Early life Hilton was born in Miami, Florida, to Cuban parents. He was raised in Little Havana and Westchester, Florida, and later attended Belen Jesuit Preparatory School, an all-boys Catholic school in Miami. Hilton graduated in 1996, and the aspiring actor received a scholarship to New York University. Blogging career After graduating from New York University in 2000 and before beginning his blogging career, Hilton attempted a career as an actor. He also briefly worked as a media relations assistant for the LGBT rights organization GLAAD, was a freelance writer for gay publications, worked as a receptionist for the NYC gay events club Urban Outings, and was briefly the managing editor of Instinct, a gay men's magazine. He says he started blogging \"because it seemed easy\". Hilton's angle on celebrity gossip includes an unapologetic desire to mingle with and be a part of celebrity culture. He often comments on celebrity awards shows, clubs, and private events he has attended, and posts photographs of himself with the celebrities he writes about under the \"Personally Perez\" category of his blog. Although Hilton has an affinity for some celebrities, such as Lady Gaga and Sophia Bush, he also has a \"vendetta\" against certain stars, such as Disney Channel star Vanessa Hudgens and Gossip Girl teen actress Taylor Momsen. Teen phenomenon Miley Cyrus publicized her personal disapproval of Hilton via Twitter to which he replied. Some have suggested, however, that Hilton's proximity to the celebrities about whom he writes has led to biased coverage on his blog. He purports to have befriended Paris Hilton, the source of his stage name and frequent subject of his posts. It has been noted, for example, that he rarely reports on stories or rumors casting Paris Hilton in a negative or unflattering light, and that, unlike most gossip blogs, he often acknowledges and praises her positive achievements. Additionally, Hilton has been known to speak out publicly against discriminatory behavior of celebrities and other public figures. He called for the firing of Isaiah Washington from ABC television series Grey's Anatomy for making homophobic remarks and called for his readers to do the same. In early 2007, Hilton was criticized by The Hollywood Gossip blog for ignoring racist and homophobic remarks made by Paris Hilton. Hilton often promotes his favorite up-and-coming musicians by posting streams of their songs under the \"Listen to This\" category of his blog. London-based singer Mika's 2007 rise to popular success in North America has been partially attributed to Hilton's frequent support. Hilton and Mika also claim to be friends. Blogging success During an interview in Cliché Magazine (June/July 2010), Hilton said that he only started blogging as a hobby. \"What set my site apart is that prior to PerezHilton.com, most blogs were mainly online journals and diaries, but that never interested me. I wanted to talk about celebrities because they're far more entertaining.\" On March 11, 2005, within the first six months of Hilton's blogging career, PageSixSixSix.com was named \"Hollywood's Most-Hated Website\" by The Insider, catalyzing an initial surge in its popularity which temporarily crippled its server. Hilton claimed that on July 30, 2007, a seemingly \"ordinary day\", PerezHilton.com had over 8.82 million page views in a 24-hour period. Other sources dispute the reliability of Hilton's traffic claims. Pop singer Fergie has confirmed that she is referring to Hilton in her song \"Pedestal\" (2006), in which she criticizes an unidentified person for making negative remarks about her on the Internet. On August 17, 2007, citing exclusive sources, Hilton announced the death of Cuban President Fidel Castro and claimed that he was the first media outlet in the world to break the news. Although Hilton claimed that US officials would be making an announcement within hours, no announcement was made, and no major media outlets verified Castro's death. The Associated Press later determined that rumors were sparked by a meeting of Miami officials who were to discuss the city's plans when Castro dies. Rumors were further fueled by a road closure in the Florida Keys that was due to a police standoff. Castro appeared in an interview on Cuban television on September 21, 2007, \"looking frail but sounding lucid\", and mocking rumors of his death. On September 9, 2009, Perez appeared on The Tyra Banks Show and cited his premature reporting of Castro's death as his \"one regret.\" On September 15, 2008, Terra.com named Hilton the \"Hispanic of the Year\" in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month. In an article dated October 2014, the popularity of the site was trending slightly down, as PerezHilton.com was ranked by Alexa as the 1,234th most trafficked website globally. In the media Television In 2001, Hilton made an appearance in the third episode of the third season of The Sopranos, \"Fortunate Son\". His character hands over the proceeds of a Jewel benefit concert at Rutgers University, whose ticket office Christopher Moltisanti and Benny Fazio rob at gunpoint. In 2004, a then- Hilton appeared as a contestant on the \"Madonna Style\" episode of VH1's reality weight loss show, Flab To Fab. At the time, Hilton had 30% body fat and a waist. Hilton lost a total of in three months and dropped around his waist, leaving him at and a waist for his frame, and a greatly reduced level of body fat. On July 13, 2007, Hilton announced on the TV show The View that he would star in his own reality television show on VH1. The series of six one-hour episodes, titled What Perez Sez, aired its first part on September 11, 2007. Hilton appeared as a contestant on MTV's Celebrity Rap Superstar, which debuted August 30, 2007. He was eliminated in week six of the contest by judges' vote. On September 29, 2007, he hosted a Best of MADtv episode featuring pop culture parody sketches from previous seasons. He has appeared in music videos such as Simple Plan's \"When I'm Gone\", The Pussycat Dolls's \"Hush Hush\", Rihanna's \"S&M\" and in the video of the Latin music Anahí and Christian Chávez \"Libertad\". Hilton has also appeared in reality shows such as Victoria Beckham: Coming to America, MTV Cribs, The N's Queen Bees, Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List, Tori Spelling THS and Paris Hilton's My New BFF. In addition to reality television, Hilton has guest starred as himself in scripted shows such as Privileged. Hilton is also a regular on series such as TRL, MuchMusic, and Extra where he appears via satellite from his closet studio to talk about gossip. He co-hosted the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards and after Rick Astley did not show up to collect his award for best act ever at the MTV Europe Music Awards, Perez Hilton collected the prize on Astley's behalf. On June 21, 2009, Hilton was a presenter at the 2009 MuchMusic Video Awards in Toronto, Ontario. On December 2, 2009, Hilton was a guest on the TV show The View. In 2010, Hilton guest starred as himself in the episode Victorious \"Wi-Fi in the Sky\". Hilton created and presented four-part British television series, Perez Hilton Superfan for ITV2 in December 2011. On the edition of January 16, 2012 of WWE Raw, Hilton was a special guest referee for a Divas tag team match, between The Bella Twins and Kelly Kelly and Eve, stopping the twins' switch place and win. In April 2012, he appeared on Oprah's Lifeclass live at New York City's Radio City Music Hall, along with Oprah Winfrey and Deepak Chopra, talking about how after his \"spiritual awakening\", he changed his past celebrity bashing ways and how he had found a new purpose. In January 2015, Hilton took part as a housemate on the fifteenth season of the British reality series, Celebrity Big Brother. He became the seventh celebrity to be evicted on February 4, 2015. In August 2017, Hilton was a contestant on Worst Cooks in America Season 11: Celebrity Edition 3. He won the competition and was crowned \"Best of the Worst\". In December 2020, Hilton was permanently banned from TikTok, where he had amassed 1.6 million followers. Hilton released a video of himself crying, in reaction to the ban, and begging TikTok 'influencer' Charli D'Amelio, who he had criticized, for help in having him reinstated. In December 2021, Hilton was a guest star on Red Table Talk: The Estefans alongside singer-songwriter Gabbie Hanna for a discussion about cancel culture. Live theater Hilton starred as himself in NEWSical The Musical, an off-Broadway musical which had a four-week run, beginning on September 8, 2012. Hilton stated, \"I am beyond thrilled, nervous and zen about making my New York theater debut. It's gonna be a wild ride in a show that guarantees to put smiles on people's faces. It will be no holds barred pure unadulterated fun. I expect to have the time of my life and look forward to hugging happy theatergoers after each show.\" Hilton starred as Danny Tanner/Bob Saget in Full House! The Musical, also an off-Broadway musical which ran at Theater 80 in New York City from September 10, 2015, through November 29, 2015. The musical was a satire on the sitcom Full House that aired on the American Broadcasting Company from 1987 through 1995. Radio, YouTube, and podcast Hilton premiered his nationally syndicated radio show, Radio Perez, which included updates from his blog, on May 5, 2008. He has also appeared on The Howard Stern Show on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. Hilton runs two YouTube channels: Perez Hilton, where he does daily celebrity gossip live streams, and Perez Hilton and Family, where he covers his personal life. The latter has over 350,000 followers. In July 2015, Hilton and radio personality Chris Booker started a weekly podcast called The Perez Hilton Podcast with Chris Booker. The description is \"A meeting of the minds, these two very different personalities chime in and clash over the week’s hottest topics.\" The two held a live taping on April 27, 2019, at The Space in Las Vegas. Legal issues and controversies Civil litigation A suit against Hilton for copyright infringement was filed by Zomba Label Group on October 11, 2007, stating that Hilton had illegally posted recordings by Britney Spears on PerezHilton.com. The illegal postings include at least 10 completed songs and unfinished recordings leaked over a period of three months. The suit asks for real and punitive damages in an unspecified amount as well as legal costs. Spears is not a party to the suit. In March 2008, Hilton announced on his blog that he would no longer blog about artists signed to Sony BMG (which owned Zomba at the time). However, when the lawsuit was settled in November of that year, Hilton ended his boycott and resumed regular blogging about Sony BMG artists. On October 11, 2007, a judge cleared the way for Hilton to be deposed in an ongoing defamation suit brought against him by DJ Samantha Ronson, after a post on PerezHilton.com claimed that she had planted cocaine in friend Lindsay Lohan's car and set Lohan up to be photographed while under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Hilton's report was a repetition of gossip initially posted on CelebrityBabylon.com. The judge was informed in court that the owner of that site has already settled the case with Ronson. On January 23, 2008, Perez Hilton was awarded $85,000 by superior court Judge Elihu Berle in this lawsuit filed by Ronson. Hilton has attracted lawsuits due to his use of video footage of celebrities on his blog. He was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by attorneys for Irish actor Colin Farrell on July 18, 2005, after posting a link to Farrell's sex tape with then-girlfriend Nicole Narain on his site and on February 20, 2007, a lawsuit filed against him by Universal City Studios Productions LLP for posting a topless image of actress Jennifer Aniston that was allegedly \"misappropriated and illegally copied\" from unreleased footage from her 2006 motion picture The Break-Up. Bloggers, journalists, news agencies and photographers alike have charged that Hilton posts paparazzi photographs and other copyrighted content from their sites. On November 30, 2006, the photo agency X17Online filed a lawsuit against Hilton in federal court, seeking over $7.5 million in damages for copyright infringement. X17's co-owner Robin Navarre told the Los Angeles Times that the sale value of their photographs has been significantly reduced because the photos have appeared on PerezHilton.com before they could be published in magazines to which exclusivity is important. Navarre said: Hilton defends his use of this material by claiming it under the fair use exception to the Copyright Act; that is, according to the Los Angeles Times, the photos are altered \"to achieve a satiric or humorous end\". On March 9, 2007, a judge ruled that Hilton could continue operating his website while the lawsuit remained before the courts. On April 23, 2007, a consortium of five celebrity photo agencies filed a joint lawsuit in federal district court in California against Hilton, claiming more than $7 million in damages from 25 instances of alleged copyright infringement. Days later, on April 26, 2007, upon arriving in Sydney, Australia, to attend the MTV Australia Video Music Awards, Hilton was served with a lawsuit by celebrity photo agency PhotoNews claiming C$4,200 in damages for his alleged unauthorized use of a single copyrighted paparazzi photograph of John Mayer and Jessica Simpson. In June 2007, Hilton's web hosting service dropped his site upon threats of liability in the cases outlined above. Navarre called this \"the first victory, and we put a lot of work into trying to get this to happen.\" He added, \"It's a precedent that's huge. When we were talking to Crucial Paradigm they were saying they were not responsible, dragging their feet. We had to threaten them and show them they were liable. His new host is Blogads, and we are contacting them already.\" On June 26, 2007, Hilton posted an open call on his blog to all of X17's photographers, both past and present, to contact him if they have not been adequately compensated for working overtime or pictures submitted in the past. Hilton has not used photos by X17 on his website since the suit. In August 2009, X17's lawsuit against Hilton was settled out of court. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Outing celebrities On his blog, Hilton is open about his homosexuality and about his desire to out those who he claims are closeted gay celebrities. When former NSYNC member Lance Bass came out as gay on July 26, 2006, Hilton received criticism for having been partially responsible in the outing. \"It upsets me that people think what I'm doing is a bad thing,\" Hilton told Access Hollywood. \"I don't think it's a bad thing. If you know something to be a fact, why not report it? Why is that still taboo?\" On November 2, 2006, another celebrity often questioned by Hilton for remaining closeted, actor Neil Patrick Harris, revealed that he is gay. Members of the gay community who have criticized Hilton's outing include editor of The Advocate Corey Scholibo, AfterElton.com editor Michael Jensen, and Damon Romine, spokesperson for GLAAD. Kim Ficera, of AfterEllen.com, wrote: Some fellow gossip bloggers have also objected to his approach. Trent Vanegas, who runs Pink Is the New Blog, told Salon.com, \"I do not outright call people gay. I do not feel it is my place, or anyone else's place, to make people come out of the closet. Being shockingly hurtful just to get attention is not my style.\" David Hauslaib of gossip blog Jossip.com stated, \"The rationale that he's doing this for the good of that gay community is tantamount to saying that there is a gay agenda. Is this a positive for the gay community? I'd say, 'No.'\" Author, screenwriter, and former friend Japhy Grant also questioned his motives, writing on Salon.com, \"Spreading gossip is just your average pedestrian variety of immorality. Claiming that you're doing it to further civil rights is an outright sham.\" When questioned on Midweek Politics about whether reporting on celebrities' sexual orientation incites homophobia by making it news, Hilton indicated that he did not believe so. He said that coming out in Hollywood is not necessarily a bad thing, citing Ellen DeGeneres and Rosie O'Donnell as examples: \"I know there is some controversy about outing people, but I also believe the only way we are gonna have change is with visibility. And if I have to drag some people screaming out of the closet, then I will. I think that lots of celebrities have an archaic fear that being gay will hurt their career but look at Rosie. Look at Ellen.\" Some prominent gay rights advocates disagree. GLAAD spokesperson Damon Romine told Salon.com, \"Media speculation about a celebrity's orientation is not something we support. This kind of gossip can lead some people to the decision to come out, as we have seen recently, or it may drive others further into the closet. People are going to become more guarded and secretive and not less, because they do not want to create any opportunities [for anyone to out them].\" Actor Bruce Vilanch said, \"What purpose does it serve? These [people like Perez] are professional homosexuals. They are gay people for a living. They have to respect the rights of homosexuals who are not professional.\" In an article entitled Just How Dangerous is Perez Hilton?, AfterElton.com suggested that Hilton's actions put people's careers at risk, because anti-gay bias is still a prominent part of American culture. He continued, \"Both as a gay man and a journalist, I question whether the gay community should approve of Hilton's actions. Being associated with someone who publishes photos of panty-less starlets and scribbles dirty notes [...] makes us look infantile and ridiculous.\" Miss USA 2009 Hilton served as a judge for the Miss USA 2009 pageant in Las Vegas on April 19, 2009. During the questions and answers portion of the contest, Hilton asked the Miss California USA representative, Carrie Prejean, whether she believed every state should legalize same-sex marriage. She responded that she believes marriage is between a man and a woman due to her upbringing. After the pageant, Perez Hilton made derogatory comments about the contestant and told ABC news, \"She lost it because of that question. She was definitely the front-runner before that\", leading some to believe that the answer directly had caused her to lose the competition. Prejean stated that Miss California USA officials had pressured her to apologize for her statement and \"not talk\" about her Christian faith. After the pageant, Hilton posted a video blog on his website, where he called Prejean a \"dumb bitch\" and said her answer was the worst in pageant history. Several politicians and commentators, including gay rights activists, condemned both Hilton and Prejean for making bigoted comments. However, some people, including a few gay rights activists, defended Prejean for exercising her right to free speech, saying that expressing one's views, no matter how offensive they may be, does not justify the use of misogynistic slurs against that person. Post-MMVA 2009 incident in Toronto In June 2009, Hilton alleged in a video blog that he was assaulted by The Black Eyed Peas' operation manager, Polo Molina, following the 2009 MuchMusic Video Awards after party, where the group's lead vocalist, will.i.am, was DJing; Hilton reported that he was struck in the eye by Molina. Will.i.am also released a video statement in which he stated he had approached Hilton regarding derogatory comments made by the blogger concerning bandmate Fergie and the group's latest release The E.N.D.. During the incident, Hilton called will.i.am a \"faggot.\" Hilton later admitted in an interview with The Advocate that he originally considered using the word \"nigger\" instead in order to provoke a reaction from him, and it was at this point that Molina allegedly attacked Hilton. Will.i.am claimed the attacking party was a fan, although Molina was detained and appeared in Toronto Courthouse as a result of the incident. Hilton later filed a lawsuit against Molina, seeking an unspecified amount over $25,000 to cover medical costs and as compensation for the \"humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional and physical distress\" that Hilton suffered as a result of the attack. The GLAAD called upon Hilton to apologize for using an anti-gay slur against will.i.am during the incident, saying, \"We have reached out to Hilton and asked him to apologize [...] and we would ask media outlets to avoid repetition of the slur in their coverage of this story.\" Hilton initially refused to apologize, saying, \"I am saddened GLAAD chose to victimize me further by criticizing me for how I non-violently dealt with a very scary situation that, unfortunately, turned violent.\" On June 25, 2009, however, Hilton did apologize, stating \"I am NOT apologizing to GLAAD...I am apologizing to the gay community, to anyone who was hurt by my choice of words, and to all the people who have ever emailed me to thank me for all that I have done to fight for gay rights over the last few years.\" In addition, he pledged to donate any money won in the lawsuit against Molina to the Matthew Shepard Foundation. In a statement released on its website, Judy Shepard, chair of the MSF, declined the gift, saying that \"because the lawsuit presumably involves the physical attack prompted by Mr. Hilton's admitted use of an anti-gay slur, the Foundation will be unable to accept any funds obtained in such a manner.\" Hilton received little sympathy in the media over the incident, a fact he addressed in his video blog. John Mayer made comments ridiculing Hilton and the incident on his Twitter page, resulting in an exchange of insults between the two. Gawker viewed Hilton's public apology with skepticism, viewing it as an attempt to rebuild his \"brand\" and a possible attempt to persuade Canadian authorities from filing criminal charges against him for his use of hate speech during the incident. Michael Jackson's death On June 25, 2009, shortly after Michael Jackson had gone into cardiac arrest, Hilton posted an article about Jackson's illness, claiming it was a publicity stunt. Hilton's original post featured sarcastic comments such as \"Get your money back, ticket holders!!!!\" and \"[Jackson] pulled a similar stunt when he was getting ready for his big HBO special in '95 when he 'collapsed' at rehearsal!\", in response to Jackson's recently sold-out tour through March 2010. Upon realizing Michael Jackson's death was not a hoax, Hilton immediately deleted the original news post and replaced it with a shorter message that linked to a story at entertainment news site TMZ, which said the singer had in fact gone into cardiac arrest. Hilton has received backlash for the incident, becoming entangled in a Twitter argument with Pete Wentz about the situation. Miley Cyrus upskirt picture On June 13, 2010, Hilton posted to Twitter a message linking to an upskirt picture of then-17-year-old Miley Cyrus, that appeared to show Cyrus without underwear. Since Cyrus was still legally a minor at the time, questions were raised as to whether or not child pornography charges could be raised. The site that he had linked to had removed the picture in question. Perez responded to the accusations by claiming that the controversy was \"fake\" and that Cyrus did wear underwear in the photo in question. Hilton did not re-post the photo for proof. Instead, he linked to another image of Cyrus, supposedly taken on the same occasion, to prove that she had been wearing underwear. Anti-bullying campaign In October 2010, Hilton became involved in the It Gets Better Project started by Dan Savage, urging celebrities to support gay teenagers who were being driven to suicide by anti-gay bullying. This prompted Khloé Kardashian to describe Hilton as her \"personal bully,\" stating that it seemed hypocritical to make an anti-bullying message at the request of a man who had repeatedly bullied her. On October 13, 2010, Hilton posted a video on YouTube entitled \"I'm Going To Be Doing Things Differently,\" in which he addressed his actions over the previous years, and apologized for bullying celebrities. Hilton vowed to change the occasionally malicious tone of his website, even if it meant losing readers and revenue. Hilton also announced the launch of three new websites: CoCoPerez.com, which focuses on fashion, FitPerez.com, which encourages physical fitness, and TeddyHilton.com, an animal rights site. Hilton stated that his own son, Mario Armando Lavandeira III, will likely be bullied as well. Hilton said, \"He will probably be bullied out and about because people might say things to me in front of him when we are in public... That is even one of the reasons why, even though his name is Mario, I call him Perez Jr. I want him to have an alter ego as well so when people do say things that are hurtful about his dad or hurtful about him hopefully it will not hurt as much because they do not really know him. Those people know you as Perez Jr. but you are not Perez Jr. so it does not matter what they say.\" Lady Gaga In late 2011, singer/actress Lady Gaga stated on Twitter that after she cancelled her Born This Way Ball Tour in February 2013 because of a hip injury caused by repetitive movements in her show, Hilton responded by sending her a photo of a wheelchair with the word Karma written across it, and another of Madonna pointing a gun. On August 18, 2013, a Twitter user reported to Gaga that Hilton had been spotted in the singer's New York City apartment building. Gaga asked the Twitter user to enter the building and collect photographic evidence, before stating that Hilton was stalking her. Later that day, Hilton published a statement on his website in which he denied stalking Lady Gaga. He stated that he was looking for a place to live in New York after the birth of his son, and that he was shown the apartment without knowing Lady Gaga lived in the building. Ariana Grande In February 2014, after Hilton criticized Ariana Grande's hairstyles, Grande's fans posted negative comments to Hilton's social media, including threats against his young son. Hilton then tweeted Grande, her brother Frankie and her employer Nickelodeon with accusations that Grande had been seen using cocaine at a party. Grande denied the allegations. Hilton demanded that Grande speak out against her fans' comments. Grande eventually tweeted to her fans: \"...please don't wish negativity upon anyone.\" Personal life Hilton moved to Manhattan in 2013, stating, \"I love New York and that is where me and my growing family want to call home right now\". Hilton was referring to his first child, Mario Armando Lavandeira III, born on February 17, 2013, conceived with a donor egg and carried by a surrogate mother. His daughter, Mia Alma Lavandeira, was born on May 9, 2015, via surrogate. On October 4, 2017, he welcomed a second daughter, Mayte Amor, also via surrogate. In April 2018, Perez attracted some criticism of his parenting when he stated he hopes his son Mario is heterosexual because \"it would be easier\" than being homosexual. He claimed he would not sign up his son for dance classes, if requested, because \"dance class might make [his] kid gay\". Books On October 6, 2009, Celebra Books released Hilton's first book, Red Carpet Suicide: A Survival Guide on Keeping Up With the Hiltons. Tracey Lomrantz Lester of Glamour stated, \"The book gives readers the inside track to becoming \"A Hilton\"... AKA \"people we confuse with celebrities\": Pimp out your famous kids, give a fierce mug shot, use your fabulousness for good... all great pieces of advice, but let's be honest, I wanted to know more about the FASHION!\" On December 1, 2009, Celebra Books released Hilton's second book, Perez Hilton's True Bloggywood Stories: The Glamorous Life of Beating, Cheating, and Overdosing, which the NY Daily News characterized as a \"tell-all book.\" On September 1, 2011, Celebra Young Readers published Hilton's first children's book entitled The Boy with Pink Hair. Hilton described the book as a story \"about every kid that's ever had a dream, felt excluded, wanted to belong, and hoped that one day they could do what they loved and make a difference.\" In a September 2011 interview with The Advocate, Hilton admitted that the book was inspired by his own childhood: \"I've always considered myself a freak, an outsider, and a bit of an interloper. I never really fit in with any groups, so I just did my own thing.\" On October 6, 2020, Chicago Review Press published Hilton's memoir titled TMI: My Life in Scandal. In the book, Hilton unveils \"the story of how Mario Lavandeira became Perez Hilton, the world's first and biggest celebrity blogger, while also becoming the most hated man in Hollywood.\" Publishers Weekly called it \"catnip for Hollywood gossip hounds.\" Discography Hilton released a song called \"The Clap\" (2008), about gonorrhea, composed and produced by Lucian Piane. The song's music video is from the movie Another Gay Sequel: Gays Gone Wild! (2008). Singles Other appearances Hilton appears in Rihanna's video \"S&M\" (2011) \"on a leash as Rihanna's pet\".

{"text": "The École nationale supérieure d'ingénieurs de constructions aéronautiques (ENSICA), meaning National Higher School of aeronautical constructions, was a French engineering school founded in 1945. It was located in Toulouse. In 2007, Ensica merged with Supaéro to form the Institut supérieur de l'aéronautique et de l'espace (ISAE). Ensica recruited its students from the French \"Concours des Grandes Écoles\". A competitive examination which requires studies at the \"classes préparatoires\". Classes préparatoires last two years where students are to work intensively on mathematics and physics. Studies at Ensica lasted for 3 years where students eventually got a Master in Aeronautics. Area of studies cover all the fundamentals of aeronautics, including: aerodynamics, structures, fluid dynamics, thermal power, electronics, control theory, airframe systems, IT... Students are also trained to management, manufacturing, certification, and foreign languages. Main employers are Airbus, Thales, Dassault, Safran (Sagem, Snecma), Rolls-Royce, Astrium, Eurocopter. History The decree giving birth to the \"Ecole Nationale des Travaux Aéronautiques\" (ENTA) was signed in 1945. The text was then ratified by Charles de Gaulle, president of the temporary government, and by René Pleven, Finance Minister. There were 25 students in the first class and 24 of them joined the \"Ingénieurs Militaires des Travaux de l'Air\" (IMTA). In 1957, the school changed its name to the \"Ecole Nationale d'Ingénieurs des Constructions Aéronautiques\" (ENICA).The course was extended to three years and the school embarked on its new civil vocation welcoming a higher proportion of civil students. In 1961, ENICA was transferred to Toulouse, the director at that time being Emile Blouin. It then took on a new dimension and established its identity. In 1969, the school joined the competitive entrance examination system organised by the Ecoles Nationales Supérieures d'Ingénieurs (ENSI). It thus increased its recruitment standards to become one of the leading French schools. This excellence was rewarded in 1979 when it received the Médaille de l'Aéronautique from Général Georges Bousquet: ENICA then became ENSICA, Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Ingénieurs de Constructions Aéronautiques. The eighties were marked by a profound diversification in the training courses offered: opening of a \"Mastère\" degree and an Advanced Studies degree (DEA) in automatic control and mechanics, specialisations in aircraft maintenance and helicopter techniques. ENSICA became the top-listed school for students with pass marks in ENSI competitive entrance examinations and continuously increased the part set aside for research. It also internationalised its training by implementing exchange programmes with English, American and German institutes and universities. In 1994, ENSICA became a public establishment and can now sign, in its own name, agreements and conventions with other organisations and receive research contracts. Today, ENSICA has a staff of 150 people including 25 scientific directors and almost 700 part-time lecturers. The school can accommodate more than 400 students on the initial training courses and the same number of persons doing further training. The 50th class recently graduated. It included a total of 98 graduates 11 students of which did their third year of studies in a foreign university (USA, Great Britain, Germany and Sweden) and a high number of students who carried out their end of study projects abroad. Missions A public establishment under the auspices of the Ministry of Defence, ENSICA gives technological teaching courses for civil and military engineering students and offers a range of training: \"Diplôme d'Ingenieur\" (engineer's diploma) course; training for and through scientific research; a set of \"Mastère Spécialisé\" courses; further education courses; research. The engineer's course lasts three years. Departments of Ensica At ENSICA, research and training are integrated into the four training and research departments: avionics and systems, mechanical engineering, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics and computer science. All the departments are composed with a scientific staff. The staff is composed by lecturers-researchers with Ph.D's, lecturers and senior lecturers from universities and full professors. They are responsible for the research work and pedagogical engineering, as well as the coordination of the lecturers' teams. By this way, they actively participate in international actions and in industrial relations. The lecturers come, for one third, from the university and research world, for one fourth from industry and one fourth from the DGA. Human, economics, social, linguistics and multi-cultural training is under the responsibility of three departments: human and social sciences, sports and languages. Main departments are Avionics, Mechanical Engineering, Fluid Dynamics and Mathematics Avionics The Avionics & Systems Department develop : - In the first year a basic training in: Signal processing, Automatic System and Electrical Engineering. - In the third year, two advanced itineraries are proposed into the field : Signals - Communications Control - Avionics The Department trains at these multidisciplinary itineraries : Aircraft system Space systems Control - Guidance Radar - Telecommunications Preparation for the post-graduate diplomas DEA (Advanced Studies Diploma) : Signals - images - acoustics automatics systems. These two itineraries allow, respectively, the preparation for the postgraduate diplomas signals-images-acoutics and automatic systems. Taught subjects Functional approach of electronics and electric engineering Strong theorical bases of signal processing allowing a use in image processing, radar and telecommunications. Optics and optronics bases. Antennas and radars theories and applications in the aeronautical and spatial domains. Approach of real-time systems based on a concrete system built on a micro controller. Finally, control : from modelisation and control of simple processes to applied advanced methods in the aeronautical domain. Mechanical engineering The aim of the Mechanical engineering Department's curriculum is to provide the students with basic knowledge in mechanics indispensable for their future jobs as engineers and this within a multidisciplinary aerospace training framework. The Mechanical Engineering courses lasts three years and includes : - basic training including fundamental knowledge mainly concerning calculation of structures and technological knowledge of mechanisms, manufacturing and materials, - training applied to aeronautics and space; this part increasing progressively throughout the three years. This common core is complemented, within the scope the third-year optional modules, by courses given at ENSICA for the Mechanical Engineering advanced studies degree and more specialised courses related to aeronautics and space. The Mechanical Engineering Department also coordinates the school's space activities: this specific space training corresponds to around 250 hours and development is oriented both towards ultralight systems and crewed flight engineering. Fluid Dynamics The courses given by the Fluid Mechanics Department concern the thermodynamics of irreversible processes and continuum mechanics. The courses in these two disciplines are given in the first year and are completed by a basic fluid mechanics course (general equations of the movement of a Newtonian fluid and inviscid fluid movements). In the second year, the studies concern the flow of incompressible viscous fluids and compressible inviscid fluids dealing with the boundary layer, shock wave and turbulence phenomena with complements in unsteady fluid hypersonic and mechanical phenomena. From these theoretical bases, aeronautical applications are introduced in the second year. They mainly concern: external aerodynamics plus flight mechanics and handling qualities. aeronautical turbine engines. Mathematics The goals of CS training are: (1) to study the methods for developing programs (specification methods, object-oriented design, structured programming algorithms, testing); (2) to learn the basics of algorithmics (3) in-depth study of object programming, and learning an object-oriented methodology that uses UML as modeling notation; (4) to study the specific features of \"Real-Time\" applications and systems and of new-generation network architectures in close association with the research work carried out in the department. Practical implementations of theoretical concepts are based on Java language; ENSICA is co-accredited for issuing the Toulouse Systems Postgraduate School's Computer-based Systems DEAs (Advanced Studies Degrees) in cooperation with UPS science university, INSA and SUPAERO engineering schools, and the Toulouse CS and Telecommunications Postgraduate School's Networks and Telecommunications DEAs in cooperation with INPT engineering school, UPS science university, SUPAERO, INSA, ENST and ENAC engineering schools.

{"text": "The culture of North Africa encompasses the customs and traditions of art, architecture, music, literature, lifestyle, philosophy, food, politics and religion that have been practiced and maintained by the numerous ethnic groups of North Africa. North Africa encompasses the northern portion of Africa, including a large portion of the Sahara Desert. The region's commonly defined boundaries include Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, and Western Sahara, stretching from the Atlantic shores of the Western Sahara in the west, to Egypt's Red Sea coast in the east. The United Nations' definition additionally includes Sudan in the region. The inhabitants of North Africa are roughly divided in a manner corresponding to the principal geographic regions of North Africa: the Maghreb, the Nile valley, and the Sahel. The countries of North Africa all have Modern Standard Arabic as their official language, and almost all their inhabitants follow Islam. The most spoken dialects are Maghrebi Arabic, a form of Classical Arabic dating back from the 8th century AD, and Egyptian Arabic. The largest and most numerous ethnic group in North Africa are the Arabs. In Algeria and Morocco, Berbers are the second largest ethnic group after the Arab majority. Arabs constitute 70% to 80% of the population of Algeria, 92%97% of Libya, 67% to 70% of Morocco and 98% of Tunisia's population. The Berbers comprise 20% of Algeria, 10% of Libya, 35% of Morocco and 1% of Tunisia's population. The region is predominantly Muslim with a Jewish minority in Morocco and Tunisia, and significant Christian minority—the Copts—in Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, and Tunisia. In 2001, the number of Christians in North Africa was estimated at 9 million, the majority of whom live in Egypt, with the remainder live in Maghreb countries. North Africa formerly had a large Jewish population, almost all of whom emigrated to France or Israel when the North African nations gained independence. Prior to the modern establishment of Israel, there were about 600,000-700,000 Jews in Northern Africa, including both Sephardi Jews (refugees from France, Spain and Portugal from the Renaissance era) as well as indigenous Mizrahi Jews. Today, fewer than fifteen thousand remain in the region—almost all in Morocco and Tunisia—and are mostly part of a French speaking urban elite. (See Jewish exodus from Arab lands.) North Africans share a large amount of their genetic, ethnic, cultural and linguistic identity and influence with the Middle East, a process that began with the Neolithic Revolution and pre Dynastic Egypt. The countries of North Africa are also a major part of the Arab world. The Islamic influence in North Africa is significant, with the region being major part of the Muslim world. North Africa is associated with the Middle East in the realm of geopolitics to form the Middle East-North Africa (MENA) region. Algeria Modern Algerian literature has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history. Famous novelists of the 20th century include Mohammed Dib, Albert Camus, and Kateb Yacine, while Assia Djebar is widely translated. Important novelists of the 1980s included Rachid Mimouni, later vice-president of Amnesty International, and Tahar Djaout, murdered by an Islamist group in 1993 for his secularist views. As early as Roman times, Apuleius, in M'Daourouch, was native to what would become Algeria. In philosophy and the humanities, Malek Bennabi and Frantz Fanon are noted for their thoughts on decolonization, while Augustine of Hippo was born in Tagaste (about 60 miles from the present day city of Annaba), and Ibn Khaldun, though born in Tunis, wrote the Muqaddima while staying in Algeria. Algerian culture has been strongly influenced by Islam, the main religion. The works of the Sanusi family in pre-colonial times, and of Emir Abdelkader and Sheikh Ben Badis in colonial times, are widely noted. The Algerian musical genre best known abroad is raï, a pop-flavored, opinionated take on folk music, featuring international stars such as Khaled and Cheb Mami. However, in Algeria itself the older, highly verbal chaabi style remains more popular, with such stars as El Hadj El Anka or Dahmane El Harrachi. The tradition of raï emerged in the city of Oran by the end of the 20th century as a combination of popular music and traditional Bedouin desert music. For more classical tastes, Andalusi music, brought from Al-Andalus by Morisco refugees, is preserved in many older coastal towns. Algerian clothing is the traditional clothing worn and preserved by Algerians. It is influenced by the country's rich history and cultural heritage. It varies among different regions and communities within Algeria. Traditional Algerian clothing is Islamic custom, although there are Algerians who adopted clothing based on Western style, especially in the cities. In urban areas, there is a mix of traditional clothing and increasingly common Western style clothing, whereas traditional clothing is much more common in rural areas. As an Islamic country, Algeria has limits on dress code. Most Algerians follow Islamic dress codes, and foreigners are expected to show modesty, such as female visitors having to avoid exposing their shoulders, knees or chest. Egypt Egyptian culture has six thousand years of recorded history. Ancient Egypt was among the earliest civilizations. For millennia, Egypt maintained a strikingly complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. After the Pharaonic era, Egypt itself came under the influence of Hellenism, for a time Christianity, and later, Arab and Islamic culture. Today, many aspects of Egypt's ancient culture exist in interaction with newer elements, including the influence of modern Western culture, itself with roots in Ancient Egypt. Egypt's capital city, Cairo, is Africa's largest city and has been renowned for centuries as a center of learning, culture and commerce. Egypt has had a thriving media and arts industry since the late 19th century, today with more than 30 satellite channels and over 100 motion pictures produced each year. Cairo in fact has long been known as the \"Hollywood of the East.\" To bolster its media industry further, especially with the keen competition from the Persian Gulf Arab States and Lebanon, a large media city was built. Egypt is also the only Arabic-speaking country with an opera house. Some famous Egyptians include: Saad Zaghlul (leader of first modern Egyptian revolution; founder of Wafd political party) Gamal Abdel Nasser (former president and mastermind of the present republic) Anwar Sadat (former president; winner of the Nobel Peace Prize) Boutros Boutros-Ghali (former Secretary General of the United Nations) Naguib Mahfouz (Nobel Prize-winning novelist) Umm Kulthum (singer) Omar Sharif (actor) Ahmed Zewail (Nobel Prize-winning chemist) Mohamed ElBaradei (Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency; 2005 Nobel Peace Prize Winner) For more famous Egyptians, see List of Egyptians and Egyptians Libya Libyan culture is, to a certain extent, similar to that of its other Arab neighbour states and the Libyan people very much consider themselves as part of a wider Arab community. The primary language is a colloquial form of Arabic that is unique to the area around Libya. There seem to be two distinct dialects and a couple of village and tribal dialects. Libyan Arabs have a heritage in the traditions of the nomadic Bedouin and associate themselves with a particular Bedouin tribe. Family life is important for Libyan families. Most Libyans live in apartment blocks and various kinds of independent housing units depending on their income status. Most of the Arabs who have lived a nomadic lifestyle, traditionally in tents, have been settled into various towns and cities in Libya, their old way of life fading out. It is believed that there are still some who do live as they have for centuries in the desert, though no one knows their exact numbers. Most of the population are engaged in occupations in industry and services and a small percentage in agriculture. Similar to some other countries in the Arab world, Libya can boast few theatres or art galleries. Public entertainment is almost non-existent even in the big cities. Most Libyans instead enjoy regular trips to the many beaches of the country. They also visit Libya's many beautifully preserved archeological sites, especially that of Leptis Magna which is widely considered to be one of the best preserved Roman archeological sites in the world. The nation's capital Tripoli boasts a number of museums and archives including the National Archives, the Government Library, the Ethnographic Museum, the Archaeological Museum, the Epigraphy Museum and the Islamic Museum. The Jamahirirya museum, built in consultation with UNESCO is possibly the country's most famous and houses one of the finest collections of classical art in the Mediterranean. There has recently been something of a revival of the arts in Libya, especially in the field of painting and private galleries are springing up to provide a showcase for new talent. Conversely, for many years there have been no public theatres and only a few cinemas showing foreign films. The tradition of folk culture is still alive and well, with troupes performing music and dance at frequent festivals, both in Libya and abroad. The main output of Libyan Television is devoted to showing various styles of traditional Libyan music. Traditional Tuareg music and dance are popular in Ghadames and the south. Morocco Morocco is predominantly composed of Arabs who comprise 67% of the population, while Berbers make up 31% and Sahrawis make up 2%. While the two official languages of Morocco are Standard Arabic and Standard Moroccan Berber, according to the 2014 general census, 92% of Moroccans speak Moroccan Arabic (Darija) as a native language. About 26% of the population speaks a Berber language, in its Tarifit, Tamazight, or Tashelhit varieties. Each region possesses its own elements, contributing, thus, to the making of national culture and to the civilization legacy. Morocco has set among its top priorities the protection of its legacy and the preservation of its cultural identity. Sudan Music of Sudan List of writers from Sudan Islam in Sudan Sudan's largest Christian denominations are the Roman Catholic Church, the Episcopal Church of the Sudan, the Presbyterian Church in the Sudan and the Coptic Orthodox Church. Tunisia See also: Islam in Tunisia Music of Tunisia Tunisian Arabic Western Sahara The major ethnic group in the Western Sahara is the Sahrawis, a nomadic or bedouin tribal or ethnic group, speaking the Ḥassānīya dialect of Arabic, which is also the majority dialect in Mauritania. They are of mixed Arab-Berber descent, but claim descent from the Beni Hassan, a Yemeni tribe supposed to have migrated across the desert in the 11th century. Generally indistinguishable from the Hassaniya speaking tribes of neighboring Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria, Western Saharan Sahrawi people differ from their neighbors largely due to their exposure to Spanish colonial domination. All the surrounding territories were during the late 19th and early 20th century period of European colonial rule were generally under French colonial rule. Like other neighboring Saharan bedouin and Hassaniya groups, the Sahrawis are Muslims of the Sunni sect and the Maliki law school. Local religious custom 'urf is, like other Saharan groups, heavily influenced by pre-Islamic Berber and African practises, and differs substantially from urban practises. For example, Sahrawi Islam has traditionally functioned without mosques in the normal sense of the word, in an adaptation to nomadic life. The originally clan- and tribe-based society underwent a massive social change in the process of the imposition of colonial rule and subsequent upheaval in 1975, when a part of the population was fled into exile rather than pass under Moroccan rule, and settled in the refugee camps of Tindouf, Algeria, splitting up families, clans and tribes over allegiance or opposition to the imposition of Moroccan rule. For developments among this population, see Sahrawi and Tindouf Province. Subsequent to taking effective control of the territory, the Moroccan government considerably invested in the social and economic development of the Western Sahara under its control, with special emphasis on education, modernisation and infrastructure as part of efforts to win over the population. El-Aaiun in particular has been the target of heavy government investment, and has grown rapidly. Several thousands Sahrawis study in Moroccan universities. Literacy rates are estimated at some 50% of the population. Polisario claims the refugee population in Tindouf has a literacy rate in the 90's, which would be above the verified literacy rate in the host country Algeria, recorded at roughly 86%. To date, there have been few thorough studies of the culture due in part to the political situation. Some language and culture studies, mainly by French researchers, have been performed on Sahrawi communities in northern Mauritania.
